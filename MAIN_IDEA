Dash7 makes it possible to communicate P2P and to compatible gateways using 
multiple PHY/Radio layer.

It can do it over LoRa and SigFox. Usually it communicates by itself using
FSK, and NB-IoT uses MSK, too. There is not yet support for LTE Cat-M/NB.

This makes it interesting, because with that barrier crossed, it means
P2P communications using cellular technology. Something seriously overlooked.

Seriously!

One can make a self-healing network especially for the edge cases.

How can MTN fund D7A, and myself as a sub-contractor? I'd be doing something 
incredibly cool for not much money, but who cares? 
It will come eventually.

It will be a true multi-RAT concurrent stack, something I crave.
