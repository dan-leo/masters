abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. The current expansion of the Internet of things (IoT) demands improved communication platforms that support a wide area with low energy consumption. The 3rd Generation Partnership Project introduced narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) as IoT communication solutions. NB-IoT devices should be available for over 10 years without requiring a battery replacement. Thus, a low energy consumption is essential for the successful deployment of this technology. Given that a high amount of energy is consumed for radio transmission by the power amplifier, reducing the uplink transmission time is key to ensure a long lifespan of an IoT device. In this paper, we propose a prediction-based energy saving mechanism (PBESM) that is focused on enhanced uplink transmission. The mechanism consists of two parts: first, the network architecture that predicts the uplink packet occurrence through a deep packet inspection; second, an algorithm that predicts the processing delay and pre-assigns radio resources to enhance the scheduling request procedure. In this way, our mechanism reduces the number of random accesses and the energy consumed by radio transmission. Simulation results showed that the energy consumption using the proposed PBESM is reduced by up to 34{\%} in comparison with that in the conventional NB-IoT method.},

abstract = {This paper presents continuous-wave power measurements conducted in forest terrain with a focus on path-loss in a device-to-device (D2D) communication scenario. The measurements are performed at 917.5 MHz with measurement ranges extending to more than 2.5 km, using a purpose-developed measurement system with a dynamic range of 180 dB. The impact of different antenna heights has been investigated by placing antennas at 1.5-, 2.5-, and 3.5-m elevation over the terrain. The measurements show that the antenna elevation in the given scenario has no significant impact on the received power. The measurements also show that the dominant path of propagation is through the foliage for the first approximately 1000 m, resulting in foliage excess loss being the dominant loss mechanism in this region. After approximately 1000 m, the measured received power tends to follow the fourth-power law, indicating that the dominant loss mechanism in this region is the distance-dependent path-loss. The measurement results have been compared to models proposed in the literature based on empirical data, as well as models proposed by ITU and COST. The comparison shows that only two models predicted the limit in the foliage excess loss in the measurement data. By applying these excess loss models in combination with path-loss models, it is possible to model the measured total path-loss with a root-mean-square error of less than 10 dB. This is achieved by either applying a model proposed by Tewari or a combination between the two-ray path-loss model and the ITU-R P.2108 clutter loss model.},

This system, based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology, can be deployed in three operation modes - in-band within LTE carrier, in the guard-band of LTE carrier, and stand-alone. Guard-band deployment allows the operator to support NB-IoT without requiring new spectrum and with minimal impact to LTE. This paper provides an overview and presents a study of NB-IoT deployment in LTE guard band. An analysis of coexistence of NB-IoT with LTE is presented and demonstrates that while there is mutual interference between NB-IoT and LTE on the uplink, the impact on either system is small. A performance analysis of NB-IoT is also presented. The link budget analysis demonstrates how the coverage target can be achieved for the uplink and downlink data channels. Illustrative uplink and downlink link-level simulation results are provided. The analysis in the paper shows that guard-band operation of NB-IoT is feasible and can provide support for massive number of low-throughput IoT devices.},

shown that the repetition scheme can efficiently improve the RACH

In order to develop the Cellular IOT network, discussions are focused around developing a new air interface that can leverage narrow band spectrum as well as lead to low cost modems which can be embedded into M2M/IOT devices. One key issue that arises during the development of a clean slate CIOT network is that of coexistence with the 4G networks. In this paper we explore architectures for Cellular IOT and 4G network harmonization that also addresses the one key requirement of possibly using narrow channels for IOT on the existing 4G networks and not just as a separate standalone Cellular IOT system.

Instead, future mobile networks should be flexible, providing different air-interfaces for particular users and applications. In this paper, we present HyDRA, a software-defined radio virtualization layer that enables the execution of multiple programmable air-interfaces on top of one RF front-end. Our solution multiplexes digitized IQ signal samples of multiple virtual radios into a single stream. We have implemented HyDRA and experimentally evaluate its performance in a scenario that considers a base station executing LTE and NB-IoT VRs. Results obtained show that HyDRA is able to efficiently multiplex these two technologies, while the computational analysis shows that HyDRA is not CPU-intensive and can run in standard, commodity computers.

These applications are characterized by massive connections from a large number of low-complexity and low-power devices. One of the goals of NB-IoT is to improve coverage extension beyond existing cellular technologies. In order to do that, NB-IoT introduces transmission repetitions and different bandwidth allocation configurations in uplink. These new transmission approaches yield many transmission options in uplink. In this paper, we propose analytical expressions that describe the influence of these new approaches in the transmission. Our analysis is based on the Shannon theorem. The transmission is studied in terms of the required Signal to Noise Ratio, bandwidth utilization, and energy per transmitted bit. Additionally, we propose an uplink link adaptation algorithm that contemplates these new transmission approaches. The conducted evaluation summarizes the influence of these approaches. Furthermore, we present the resulting uplink link adaptation from our proposed algorithm sweeping the device's coverage.},

To facilitate research on and application of NB-IoT, in this paper, we design a system that includes NB devices, an IoT cloud platform, an application server, and a user app. The core component of the system is to build a development board that integrates an NB-IoT communication module and a subscriber identification module, a micro-controller unit and power management modules. We also provide a firmware design for NB device wake-up, data sensing, computing and communication, and the IoT cloud configuration for data storage and analysis. We further introduce a framework on how to apply the proposed system to specific applications. The proposed system provides an easy approach to academic research as well as commercial applications.},

NB-IoT provides deep indoor coverage for thousands of low-data-rate and low-powered devices. Coverage enhancement for devices in weak coverage condition is enabled by having signal repetitions over extended period of time in order to boost the signal quality. Performance gain from repetitions of signals is limited by channel estimation quality. In this paper we analyze impact of channel coherence time on the uplink coverage. In addition to analytical performance bound and simulation results, we also present coverage performance results from practical measurements using a NB-IoT prototype. It is reported how the NB-IoT coverage improvement is limited by the channel estimation quality and coherence time of the channel.},

This paper presents some of the main application requirements for IoT, characterizing architecture, Quality of Service (QoS) features, security mechanisms, discovery service resources and web integration options and the protocols that can be used to provide them (e.g. CoAP, XMPP, DDS, MQTT-SN, AMQP). As examples of lower-level requirements and protocols, several wireless network characteristics (e.g. ZigBee, Z-Wave, BLE, LoRaWAN, SigFox, IEEE 802.11af, NB-IoT) are presented. The variety of possible applications scenarios and the heterogeneity of enabling technologies combined with a large number of sensors and devices, suggests the need for simulation and modeling tactics to describe how the previous requirements can be met. As a potential solution, the creation of simulation models and the usage of the OMNET++ simulation tool to enable meaningful IoT simulation is discussed. The analysis of the behavior of IoT applications is proposed for two use cases: Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for home and industrial automation, and Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networks for smart meters, smart buildings, and smart cities.},

Requiring only a reasonably low-cost hardware update to the already deployed Long Term Evolution (LTE) base stations and being compatible with current core network and enhanced core solutions that aim to reduce the battery consumption and minimize the signalling, NB-IoT deployments are quickly increasing, making NB-IoT a dominating technology for low-power wide area (LPWA) networks. To this aim, in this paper we focus on group communications (i.e., multicast) in NB-IoT to efficiently support the transmission of firmware, software, task updates or commands towards a large set of devices. We discuss the architectural and procedural enhancements needed to support the unique features of group communications in machine-type environments, such as customer-driven group formation. We also extend the NB-IoT frame to include a channel for multicast transmissions. Finally, we propose two transmission strategies for multicast content delivery and evaluate their performance considering the impact on the downlink background traffic and the channel occupancy.},

NB-IoT uses a design similar to Long Term Evolution (LTE), but it makes essential modifications for reducing the device complexity. NB-IoT is optimized for machine type communications, and it aims to increase coverage, reduce overhead and reduce power consumption while increasing capacity. In this paper, we present our testbed-based experimental study on the operation of NB-IoT systems in the presence of pulsed radar signals. We leverage results from our experiments in providing a comprehensive analysis on the impact of coverage and capacity of a NB-IoT base-station when it shares an uplink channel with S-band pulsed radars.

abstract = {Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a recent feature introduced by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). It is a low power wide area network technology that will enable cellular service to a massive number of low throughput IoT devices. The NB-IoT is a derivative of existing 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) that has to be delay tolerant with low cost devices. In LTE, the decoding of Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) consumes a significant amount of user equipment's (UE) battery power because of its high computational complexity and complicated search space design. Hence, the existing downlink control channel scheduling schemes for LTE cannot be reused for NB-IoT. The reduction in available bandwidth and introduction of repetitions for achieving wider coverage makes the Narrowband PDCCH (NPDCCH) search space design and its allocation even more challenging. In this paper, we first explain the NPDCCH in detail and present its design rationale. We propose several novel downlink control channel scheduling schemes for 3GPP NB-IoT and compare their performance through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.},

abstract = {Narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) is a newly developed 3GPP protocol optimized for low-power wide-area IoT applications and is evolving toward the future fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication. It specifies at least 23dBm maximum output power for long-range communication, stringent emission mask compatible with guard-band or in-band scenarios, and it supports multiple operation bands from 699 to 915MHz (LB) and from 1710 to 1980MHz (HB). For cost reduction, longer battery life, and fast time to market, the integration of high-power high-efficiency power amplifiers (PAs) on-chip is greatly demanded. To benefit from advanced CMOS technology, the digital polar transmitter has become a very attractive architecture for NB-IoT applications [1]. To simultaneously support dual bands for user flexibility, the traditional solution is to implement two separately optimized PAs [2], which requires extra design effort and increases die area. An ultra-compact single-transformer-based parallel power combiner proposed in [3] provides optimum load transformation in the two operation bands. Moreover, to support higher throughputs and achieve better spectral efficiency, high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) multi-subcarrier modulation is adopted in NB-IoT, which requires the PA to be efficient not only at peak power but also at power back-off (PBO) to extend battery life. Efficiency boosting techniques of digital Doherty PAs have been shown in [4-6], but two transformers are needed in the passive network. In this work, a high-power digital Doherty PA for NB-IoT applications is proposed and introduces a parallel-combining-transformer (PCT) power combiner for dual-band coverage, back-off efficiency enhancement, and ultra-compact implementation.},

Among others, the new technology will deliver huge capacity which can be employed for enabling the backbone connectivity for LPWAN. Therefore, there is a need to have possibility to seamlessly integrate LPWANs with the upcoming 5G. In this work, we investigate how one can integrate the LoRaWAN with the 5G Test Network (5GTN) running in the University of Oulu, Finland. Furthermore, one of the options discussed is implemented in practice and its operation is verified. At the moment the implementation is used for wide range of other research activities beside this work, enabling a third party to bring their LoRaWAN compliant devices for testing and application development.},

Transmit diversity at a base station is effective in achieving a high detection probability for the NB primary synchronization signal (NPSS) and NB secondary synchronization signal (NSSS) without increasing computational complexity at the UE. This paper investigates the effect of precoding vector switching (PVS) based transmit diversity employing up to 8 transmitter antennas on the physical cell ID (PCID) detection probability for NB-IoT. Computer simulation results show when the fading among transmitter antennas is uncorrelated, and that the NPSS detection probability using PVS based transmit diversity with N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}tx{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 4 antennas is improved by approximately 14{\%} compared to that with N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}tx{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 2 at the average received signal-to-noise power ratio of -5 dB. Moreover, the PCID detection probability with N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}tx{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 4 is improved by approximately 10{\%} compared to that with N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}tx{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 2 even for a high fading correlation among transmitter antennas such as 0.6. When increasing the N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}tx{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} value to 8, the PCID detection probability increases by approximately 8{\%} compared to that with N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}tx{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 4 for the large frequency offset of A{\textless}sub{\textgreater}f{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 70 kHz. Therefore, we conclude that the PVS based transmit diversity with more antennas up to N{\textless}sub{\textgreater}tx{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} = 8 is effective in improving the PCID detection probability when considering the actual impairments including fading correlation among transmitter antennas and frequency offset due to the frequency error of the oscillator in the IoT equipment.},

abstract = {In 3GPP, a narrowband system based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) is being introduced to support the Internet of Things. This system, named Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), can be deployed in three different operation modes - (1) stand-alone as a dedicated carrier, (2) in-band within the occupied bandwidth of a wideband LTE carrier, and (3) within the guard-band of an existing LTE carrier. In stand-alone operation mode, NB-IoT can occupy one GSM channel (200 kHz) while for in-band and guard-band operation modes, it will use one physical resource block of LTE (180 kHz). The design targets of NB-IoT include low-cost devices, high coverage (20-dB improvement over GPRS), long device battery life (more than 10 years), and massive capacity. Latency is relaxed although a delay budget of 10 seconds is the target for exception reports. The specifications for NB-IoT are expected to be finalized in 2016. In this paper, we describe the targets for NB-IoT and present a preliminary system design. In addition, coverage, capacity, latency, and battery life analysis are also presented.},

The IoT is seen as a set of vertical application domains that share a limited number of common basic functionalities. In this view, consumer-centric solutions, platforms, data management, and business models have to be developed and consolidated in order to deploy effective solutions in the specific fields. The availability of low-cost general-purpose processing and storage systems with sensing/actuation capabilities coupled with communication capabilities are broadening the possibilities of IoT leading to open systems that will be highly programmable and virtualized, and will support large numbers of application programming interfaces. These articles address several promising approaches to sensors, actuators, and new consumer devices. New communication capabilities,from short-range to low-power WAN (LPWAN) to fourth generation (4G) and 5G networks, with narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). In addition, there are new communication protocols and the exploitation of NFV/SDN for better communications. New solutions are needed for large distributed systems. New business models, ecosystems, and consumer-centric aspects need to be addressed, including IoT application development, utilization of semantics, and security, privacy, and trust.

However, its paging capacity is insufficient if legacy paging mechanism is employed, due to the contradiction between the massive devices and the limited physical band resources. In this paper, a more efficient paging message is designed based on the binary tree, to significantly reduce the message size for enough paging capacity. We propose to indicate a set of value ranges encompassing the paged User Equipment (UE) identities, rather than to list all the paged UE identities as in legacy LTE system. It is verified by theoretical analyses and numerical simulations that the proposed paging message outperforms the existing approaches in statistical criteria.},

Therefore, it has attracted attention of both academia and industry. In this paper, we present the NB-IoT development, and main characteristics and design objectives of NB-IoT according to 3GPP R13. In addition, we provide the review of related literatures about NB-IoT modeling and algorithm analysis. And we explain current problems of NB-IoT system-level modeling based on visualized simulation platform. Moreover, this paper is devoted to the construction of the NB-IoT model based on OPNET and the verification of its characteristics, such as wide coverage and high channel utilization. This paper mainly considers NB-IoT model design and realization in terms of NB-IoT physical layer characteristics. We summarize the correlated characteristics of NB-IoT uplink and downlink. Then we design and construct the NB-IoT model based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. Lastly, we use the constructed NB-IoT model for simulations and conduct an experiment on it using the LTE network with channel bandwidths of 3 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 15 MHz, and 20 MHz. The simulation results have verified the performance of NB-IoT, wherein uplink time delay is lower than 10 s, channel utilization is higher than that of LTE network, and coverage area is larger than LTE network.},

The technologies in 3GPP Release 14 evolved beyond the basic functionality specified in Release 13. In 3GPP Release 15 the evolution continues. To optimize the support for infrequent small data packet transmissions, a mechanism for data transmission during the random access procedure is specified for NB-IoT and LTE-M. This mechanism, hereafter referred to as Early Data Transmission (EDT), improves the device battery life and reduces the message latency. This article provides a description of the EDT feature and presents simulated results for the expected battery life and message latency for a set of typical IoT traffic models. For a device in extreme coverage, EDT can enable improved battery life by almost 3 years and reduce message latency by more than 3 seconds compared to the Release 13 performance. Although the absolute gains are highest for devices in challenging radio conditions, significant relative gains are also presented for devices in good coverage.},

In this paper, we propose a novel wearable personal healthcare and emergency aid system, namely WAITER. Our system does not require specific caregiver aid. WAITER just employs the tiny wearable sensors to continuously collect user's vital signals and Bluetooth device to transmit the sensory data to a mobile phone, which can perform on-site vital data storage and process. After local data process, the mobile phone can use its GSM module to periodically report users' health status to the healthcare centre and issue alert for medical aids once detecting emergency.

abstract = {The crucial aim for 5G narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is to support massive connectivity with wide coverage area, low power consumption, low hardware complexity, and low data rate. Direct conversion receiver (DCR) has a simple structure to fulfill NB-IoT requirements. However, a significant degradation has been observed on the performance of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with the DCR due to in-phase and quadrature imbalance (IQI) at RF front-end. Estimation and mitigation of IQI in OFDM systems require an iterative receiver at the expense of high complexity and power consumption. In this paper, OFDM with index modulation (OFDM-IM) is proposed as a promising candidate in order to meet the demands of NB-IoT use cases. OFDM-IM-based systems carry data information not only by modulated subcarriers but also by indices of fractionally used subcarriers. A non-iterative and efficient receiver that exploits inactive subcarriers is introduced to mitigate the effect of IQI for NB-IoT with OFDM-IM. Cyclic redundancy check algorithm is used to investigate the accuracy of the receiver under IQI. Theoretical analysis and computer-based simulations show that the proposed non-iterative receiver for OFDM-IM in NB-IoT under IQI works very well in various scenarios. Moreover, our findings show that the OFDM-IM under IQI provides higher signal-to-interference ratio in comparison with classical OFDM.},

abstract = {Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a low power wide area network (LPWAN) technique introduced in 3GPP release 13. The narrowband transmission scheme enables high capacity, wide coverage, and low power consumption communications. With the increasing demand for services over the air, wireless spectrum is becoming scarce and new techniques are required to boost the number of connected devices within a limited spectral resource to meet the service requirements. This paper provides a compressed signal waveform solution, termed fast-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (FastOFDM), to double potentially the number of connected devices by compressing occupied bandwidth of each device without compromising data rate and bit error rate performance. Simulation is first evaluated for the Fast-OFDM with comparisons to singlecarrier-frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA). Results indicate the same performance for both systems in additive white Gaussian noise channel. Experimental measurements are also presented to show the bandwidth saving benefits of Fast-OFDM. It is shown that in a line-of-sight scenario, Fast-OFDM has similar performance as SC-FDMA but with 50{\%} bandwidth saving. This research paves the way for extended coverage, enhanced capacity and improved data rate of NB-IoT in fifth generation new radio networks.},

Subsequently, we compare several performances of NB-IoT and other wireless and mobile communication technologies in aspects of latency, security, availability, data transmission rate, energy consumption, spectral efficiency, and coverage area. Moreover, we analyze five intelligent applications of NB-IoT, including smart cities, smart buildings, intelligent environment monitoring, intelligent user services, and smart metering. Finally, we summarize security requirements of NB-IoT, which need to be solved urgently.

However, current DRX schemes used in the Long Term Evolution (LTE) are inadequate to the large-scale NB-IoT system. In this paper, aim to obtain better power saving and balance weak-up latency performance as well as avoid the possible signaling storm in an NB-IoT system with massive devices, a grouping-based energy efficient DRX strategy is proposed. Moreover, different DRX schemes are devised for the group leader and group members to further reduce power consumption. A discrete time semi-Markov process is applied to numerically analyze the system performance and to obtain the power saving factor and weak-up latency. Simulations show the fact that how the various DRX parameters impact the system performance. Specifically, simulation results demonstrate our proposed DRX mechanism outperforms the LTE DRX scheme in terms of power-saving performance although at the slight and sustainable cost of latency.},

NB-IoT can enable energy-efficient communication with extended coverage on a narrow bandwidth of 180 kHz for low-cost MTC devices (MTCDs). The main challenge of supporting MTC in LTE-A Pro networks is to provide connectivity to a massive number of MTCDs. To overcome this challenge, in this paper, we propose a power-domain uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme for NB-IoT systems. By allowing multiple MTCDs to share the same sub-carrier, NOMA can provide connectivity to more MTCDs than orthogonal multiple access (OMA). We formulate a joint sub-carrier and transmission power allocation problem to maximize the number of MTCDs satisfying the quality of service (QoS) and transmission power requirements. We decompose the problem into two sub-problems and propose algorithms to solve them. Simulation results show that our proposed NOMA scheme can significantly increase the number of successfully connected MTCDs in NB-IoT systems compared to OMA.},

We investigate an LTE downlink band sharing with a 5G RAT whose subcarrier spacing is narrower than the normal subcarrier spacing (15kHz) defined in 4G OFDMA technology. This case is very important since many upcoming low-cost machines require backhaul signaling provided by widely-deployed LTE infrastructure and physical characterizations of the bands below 6 GHz for wide coverage and mobility support. However, in such heterogeneous spectrum access, the spectral sidelobe leakage caused by the legacy downlink transmission significantly interferes with the reception of the 5G signaling even when all users are perfectly synchronized. In this paper, a spectrum shaping method using embedded-GFDM waveform is therefore proposed to deal with this challenging issue. The proposed scheme warrants no impact on the signal detection of legacy receivers and gains much more spectrum efficiency compared to guard band utilization.},

abstract = {Recent advances in MEMS wearable inertial/magnetic sensors and mobile computing have fostered a dramatic growth of interest for ambulatory human motion capture (MoCap). Compared to traditional optical MoCap systems such as the optical systems, inertial (i.e. accelerometer and gyroscope) and magnetic sensors do not require external fixtures such as cameras. Hence, they do not have in-the-lab measurement limitations and thus are ideal for ambulatory applications. However, due to the manufacturing process of MEMS sensors, existing wearable MoCap systems suffer from drift error and accuracy degradation over time caused by time-varying bias. The goal of this research is to develop algorithms based on multi-sensor fusion and machine learning techniques for precise tracking of human motion and location using wearable inertial sensors integrated with absolute localization technologies. The main focus of this research is on true ambulatory applications in active sports (e.g., skiing) and entertainment (e.g., gaming and filmmaking), and health-status monitoring. For active sports and entertainment applications, a novel sensor fusion algorithm is developed to fuse inertial data with magnetic field information and provide drift-free estimation of human body segment orientation. This concept is further extended to provide ubiquitous indoor/outdoor localization by fusing wearable inertial/magnetic sensors with global navigation satellite system (GNSS), barometric pressure sensor and ultra-wideband (UWB) localization technology. For health applications, this research is focused on longitudinal tracking of walking speed as a fundamental indicator of human well-being. A regression model is developed to map inertial information from a single waist or ankle- worn sensor to walking speed. This approach is further developed to estimate walking speed using a wrist-worn device (e.g., a smartwatch) by extracting the arm swing motion intensity and frequency by combining sensor fusion and principal component analysis.},

Being positioned as having an open standard, LoRaWAN has attracted also much interest from the research community. Specifically, many papers address the efficiency of its PHY layer. However MAC is still underinvestigated. Existing studies of LoRaWAN do not take into account the acknowledgement and retransmission policy, which may lead to incorrect results. In this paper, we carefully take into account the peculiarities of LoRaWAN transmission retries and show that it is the weakest issue of this technology, which significantly increases failure probability for retries. The main contribution of the paper is a mathematical model which accurately estimates how packet error rate depends on the offered load. In contrast to other papers, which evaluate LoRaWAN capacity just as the maximal throughput, our model can be used to find the maximal load, which allows reliable packet delivery.},

LTE-M is one of the candidates to support M2M communications in Long Term Evolution (LTE) cellular networks. In this paper, we appraise and present an in depth performance evaluation of LTE-M based on cross-layer network metrics. Compared with LTE Category 0 previously released by 3GPP for MTC, simulation results show that LTE-M offers additional advantages to meet M2M communication needs in terms of wider coverage, lower throughput, and a larger number of machines connected through LTE network. However, we show that LTE-M is not yet up to the level to meet future applications requirements regarding a near-zero latency and an advanced Quality of Service (QoS) for this massive number of connected Machine Type devices (MTDs).},

One of the most promising technologies that fit the IoT vision of low-power, wide area networks (LPWAN) is the narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). While low earth orbit (LEO) satellites are favourable because of their lower round trip time (RTT) and lower propagation loss in the communication link, they come up with a significantly increased Doppler shift. In our NB-IoT over LEO satellite architecture, we identify the problem of high differential Doppler among channels of different users on Earth, which leads to the performance degradation of our system. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation approach in order to reduce the high values of differential Doppler under the maximum value supported by the standard itself.},

It provides low energy consumption and wide coverage in order to meet the requirements of its diverse applications that span social, industrial and environmental aspects. Increasing the number of repetitions of the transmission has been selected as a promising approach to enhance the coverage in NB-IoT up to 164 dB in terms of maximum coupling loss for uplink transmissions, which is a significant improvement compared with legacy LTE technologies, especially to serve users in deep coverage. However, a large number of repetitions reduces the system throughput and increases the energy consumption of the IoT devices, which reduces their battery lifetime and increases their maintenance cost. In this work, we propose a new method for enhancing the NB-IoT coverage based on machine learning algorithms. Instead of employing a random spectrum access procedure, dynamic spectrum access can reduce the number of required repetitions, increase the coverage, and reduce the energy consumption.},

abstract = {Due to the lack of spectrum resource of power wireless private network, it is difficult to guarantee the transmission for the services in the distribution network. In order to enhance the network resource utilization, this paper puts forward a method for the uplink resource scheduling of power wireless private network based on NB-IoT and LTE hybrid transmission. Firstly, through the cognizing for uplink interference among multi-cells, a novel NB-IoT and LTE hybrid transmission strategy is established. Afterwards, an uplink resource scheduling model is designed for the multi-services in distribution network. The target of this model is to sufficiently utilizing the uplink Resources Blocks (RBs) by making use of the in-band deployment mode of NB-IoT for LTE private power network. Finally, an improved artificial fish swarm algorithm is proposed for resolving this problem. The simulation result shows the novel strategy can take full advantage of the small-scale uplink scheduling of NB-IoT so that the overall resource utilization of the network can be improved efficiently. In addition, the proposed improved artificial fish swarm algorithm is also verified to have a better convergence performance.},

abstract = {With the rapid advancement and development in the field of information and communication technologies, it is possible to enable doctors to employ technology in treating the patients. By employing the technology it is easier to treat patients quickly in emergency situations where the life can be saved if adequate medical assistance is provided in time. Based on the concept of telemedicine we have designed and developed a portable telemedicine system which is very compact, user friendly and economical. The portable telemedicine is very useful in the event of life threatening situations like heart attack (Strokes), instant high body temperatures, or abnormal BP conditions etc. Now-a-days there are several telemedicine systems available in the market. However, only a few are useful in the emergency situations. These systems are expensive and bulky and out of reach for most of the common people. The purpose of this paper is to come up with a new idea where these lifesaving telemedicine devices should become affordable for common people by making use of the latest prevailing technologies. In this paper we are going to introduce `Portable Emergency System' which is based on FTC - Find-Treat-Care technique. This system is designed with the integration of various technologies such as GSM/GPRS, GPS, sensors (wearable device) and P2P. The proposed new system will be useful for common people, during the emergency situations to diagnose the mobile heart (Cardiac) patients, diabetic patients, elderly people as well as an accident victim. The prime objective of the proposed new system is to provide urgent provisional medication and shifting of patient to the nearby hospital in time which can save the life of many people before the first contact with an expert doctor.},

In normal situations, it is obvious that using a 1.4 MHz bandwidth in Long Term Evolution for Machines (LTE-M), helps in improving M2M device complexity, cost and battery life effectively. However, in emergency scenarios, an expected M2M storm will lead inevitably to a fast resource depletion accompanied by an eNodeB congestion in a split second. In this manuscript, we propose a novel scheme "LTE-M Adaptive eNodeB", which gradually solves the eNodeB overload problem, while keeping the H2H traffic QoS not to be affected badly. Moreover, We adaptively manage network resources to allow both traffic to efficiently access the LTE network via SimuLTE open-source modeler. Eventually, an evaluation of the mutual impact of M2M and H2H coexistence is also presented. Keywords— IoT, LTE-A, LTE-M, NB-IoT, LPWAN, M2M, H2H, SimuLTE, eNodeB, Overload Congestion Mechanism.},

In this paper, we present the first publicly available empirical power consumption measurements on two NB-IoT devices. The target is to provide a power consumption model for Internet of Things battery lifetime estimation. The measurement results show that the two devices consume 710-840 mW when transmitting at 23 dBm, due to a power amplifier efficiency of about 37 {\%}. Receiving control and data channels require 210- 240 mW, while the Discontinuous Reception and Power Save Mode sleep states consume 21-23 mW and 14-35 uW, respectively. In general, the power consumption levels are higher than the 3GPP estimates, and we thus estimate the battery lifetime is 21-85 {\%} shorter, with these first generation devices.},

abstract = {The Narrow-Band Internet of Things network (NB-IoT), which solves the communication problem for IoT, is growing mature rapidly and has become commercialized gradually. Network operators are investigating in the new technique. Compared with the traditional short range wireless communication technique, the entity model of the NB-IoT network is more complicated. Research on the security characteristics and the means of attack in the NB-IoT network is not sufficient by now. Problems such as effective binding between the components of the user equipment, loss or forgery of user equipment, illegal closure of the data security features, intercept of wireless communication, illegal acquisition of user privacy data still exist in the ubiquitous network. During the large scale application of such networks, numerous attacks on the user equipment and the network will occur and will cause serious security risk. Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) is the unique identity of a chip based on its physical characteristics. In this paper we first give a summery analysis of the security risks in the NB-IoT network. Then we propose the chip binding and anti-counterfeiting technique by having the PUF integrated in the chip of the NB-IoT user equipment. Considering the low power requirement of NB-IoT, we design a secure communication protocol based on PUF. Comparing with the PKI mechanism, the protocol simplifies the distribution of secret keys and certificates. Comparing with the TLS protocol, the proposed protocol simplifies the key agreement process and can still keep the high security level.},

We mainly discuss the access capacity optimization when a large number of devices are accessed in NB-IOT. In this paper, we analyze the random access procedure in detail, combined with two kinds of traffic model proposed by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) in order to get a system flow chart. Due to the non-sensitivity of NB-IOT business, we put forward a classification Back-off method to classify different types of devices in the Back-off mechanism. Simulation results have verified the efficacy of our proposed method, showing that the capacity gain, on the basis of an access number of 50 thousands, can be increased by 3{\%}-6{\%}.},

abstract = {This paper discusses data interchange formats in the context of heterogeneous networks for the Internet of Things (IoT). The wide dissemination of IoT technologies into various industries, such as agriculture and mining, reveals data transfer issues in geographically remote locations due to absence of any network infrastructure. Several technologies like LoraWAN and NB-IOT offer extended communication ranges, however they still cannot fully solve the problem. In many cases satellite networks are the only available option for transmitting IoT data to a central collection point. Our research of satellite networks showed that as of today the Iridium Short Burst Data (SBD) network is one of the best technologies suited for IoT applications. However, the SBD imposes a significant limit on the size of transmitted messages, which turns data format selection into a vitally important task. We developed a simulation model as well as a heterogeneous Iridium-LoRAWAN prototype to compare different data exchange formats. Our experiments showed more than 4 times increase in the amount of data transferred with Protocol Buffers, compared to the widely used JSON format. {\textcopyright} 2018 IEEE.},

This paper presents a new architecture which only needs one PLL. Its receiver introduces a novel cascode-mixer structure (Cascaded by two current-mode passive mixers driven by 25{\%} duty-cycle quadrature clocks). The cascode mixer makes two times mixing of RF signals using the LO1 produced by the PLL and the LO2 from the crystal reference. It achieves 18.7dB noise figure and +8.13 dBm IP1dB in simulation with a commercial 65nm RFCMOS process. It consumes 2.8mA from a 1.2V supply. IQ phase mismatch correction is also implemented in this design.},

abstract = {OAPA Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is the prominent technology that fits the requirements of future Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, due to the limited spectrum (i.e., 180 kHz) availability for NB-IoT systems, one of the key issues is how to efficiently use these resources to support massive IoT devices? Furthermore, in NB-IoT, to reduce the computation complexity and to provide coverage extension, the concept of time offset and repetition has been introduced. Considering these new features, the existing resource management schemes are no longer applicable. Moreover, the allocation of frequency band for NB-IoT within LTE band, or as a standalone, might not be synchronous in all the cells, resulting in intercell interference (ICI) from the neighbouring cells {\&} {\#}x2019; LTE users or NB-IoT users (synchronous case). In this paper, first a theoretical framework for the upper bound on the achievable data rate is formulated in the presence of control channel and repetition factor. From the conducted analysis, it is shown that the maximum achievable data rates are 89.2 Kbps and 92 Kbps for downlink and uplink, respectively. Secondly, we propose an interference aware resource allocation for NB-IoT by formulating the rate maximization problem considering the overhead of control channels, time offset and repetition factor. Due to the complexity of finding the globally optimum solution of the formulated problem, a sub-optimal solution with an iterative algorithm based on cooperative approaches is proposed. The proposed algorithm is then evaluated to investigate the impact of repetition factor, time offset and ICI on the NB-IoT data rate and energy consumption. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the non-cooperative, cooperative, and optimal scheme (i.e., no repetition) is also presented. It is shown through the simulation results that the cooperative scheme provides up to 8 {\&} {\#}x0025; rate improvement and 17 {\&} {\#}x0025; energy reduction as compared to the non-cooperative scheme.},

abstract = {Estimates of carbon uptake at the continental scale become urgently needed as the role of countries as net sinks or sources of carbon gains political and economic importance. Despite uncertainties related to radiation use efficiency, the amount of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) intercepted by the canopy is a reliable estimator of primary production. Theoretical and empirical data support the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer sensor on National Oceanic {\&} Atmospheric Administration satellites and the fraction of PAR intercepted by green canopies. It is shown, for the period 19812000, that there is an overall increase in the radiation intercepted by the canopy over South America by 1.3{\%}, with rainforests making the largest absolute contribution (45{\%}), followed by savannas (23{\%}). Under conditions of minimal agricultural use, disturbance and anthropogenic N deposition, humid temperate forests showed the highest proportional increase in NDVI during the last two decades (4.9{\%}). Deserts showed a net reduction in NDVI relative to the 19811985 average (4.4{\%}). The expansion of agriculture over the last two decades was associated with NDVI reductions over subtropical forests. NDVI trends in South American region highlight a biome-dependent imprint of major global change noticeable in only two decades.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-to-end LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University.},

These types of technologies provide the Internet of Things (IoT) devices with the ability to transmit few bytes of data for long ranges, taking into consideration minimum power consumption. In parallel, IoT applications will cover a wide range of human and life needs from smart environments (cities, home, transportation etc.) to health and quality of life. Among these popular LPWANs technologies, we have identified the unlicensed frequency band (LoRa, DASH7, SigFox, Wi-SUN, etc.), and the licensed frequency band standards (NB-IoT, LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT, etc.). In general, both types of standards only consider fixed interconnected things, and less attention has been provided to the mobility of the things or devices. In this paper, we address the mobility of the things and the connectivity in each of the three LPWAN standards: LoRaWAN, DASH7, and NB-IoT. In particular, we show how the mobility of things can be achieved when transmitting and receiving data. Then, we provide a general and technical comparison for the three standards. Finally, we illustrate several application scenarios where the mobility is required, and we show how to select the most suited standard. We also discuss the research challenges and perspectives.},

abstract = {Under the umbrella of 3GPP, radio-access technologies for mobile broadband have evolved effectively to provide connectivity to billions of subscribers and things. Within this ecosystem, the standardization of a radio technology for massive MTC applications – narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) – is also evolving. The aim is for this technology to provide cost-effective connectivity to billions of IoT devices, supporting low power consumption, the use of low-cost devices, and provision of excellent coverage – all rolled out as software on top of existing LTE infrastructure. The design of NB-IoT mimics that of LTE, facilitating radio network evolution and efficient coexistence with MBB, reducing time to market, and reaping the benefits of standardization and economies of scale. t h e b e s t w ay to provide MTC applications with cost-effective connectivity is to design the radio-access network accordingly. What is needed is a radio-access network that minimizes battery usage, covers a wide area, and functions with simplified low-cost devices while efficiently matching the varying spectrum allocations of operators. 3GPP release 13 specifications includes the NB-IoT feature, with a large degree of deployment flexibility to maximize migration possibilities and allow the technology to be deployed in GSM spectrum, in an LTE carrier, or in a WCDMA or LTE guard band. The IoT embeds a broad range of MTC applications, and among the different types, it is widely accepted that massive MTC will be the first to take off. This segment includes applications like smart metering, agriculture and real estate monitoring, as well as various types of tracking and fleet management. Often referred to as low power wide area (LPWA), networks that provide connectivity to massive MTC applications require a radio-access technology that can deliver widespread coverage, capacity, and low power consumption. Massive MTC devices typically send small amounts of data, and tend to be placed in signal-challenged locations like basements and remote rural areas. Due to the sheer numbers of devices},

abstract = {In 3GPP Rel-13, a narrowband system based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) is being introduced to provide wide-area cellular connectivity for the Internet of Things. This system, named Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), can be deployed in three different operation modes - (1) stand-alone as a dedicated carrier, (2) in-band within the occupied bandwidth of a wideband LTE carrier, and (3) within the guard-band of an existing LTE carrier. The design targets of NB-IoT include low-cost devices, high coverage (20-dB improvement over GPRS), long device battery life (more than 10 years), and massive capacity. Latency is relaxed although a delay budget of 10 seconds is the target for exception reports. This paper discusses the design and performance of the downlink and uplink data channels. Although the design of these channels is based on LTE, there are some differences, particularly in the uplink, with the introduction of subcarrier-level transmission. The similarities have enabled rapid specification, while the enhancements in the design enable the achievement of the stated targets for NB-IoT.},

abstract = {Instrumenting the physical world through large networks of wireless sensor nodes, particularly for applications like environmental monitoring of water and soil, requires that these nodes be very small, lightweight, untethered, and unobtrusive. The problem of localization, that is, determining where a given node is physically located in a network, is a challenging one, and yet extremely crucial for many of these applications. Practical considerations such as the small size, form factor, cost and power constraints of nodes preclude the reliance on GPS of all nodes in these networks. We review localization techniques and evaluate the effectiveness of a very simple connectivity metric method for localization in outdoor environments that makes use of the inherent RF communications capabilities of these devices. A fixed number of reference points in the network with overlapping regions of coverage transmit periodic beacon signals. Nodes use a simple connectivity metric, which is more robust to environmental vagaries, to infer proximity to a given subset of these reference points. Nodes localize themselves to the centroid of their proximate reference points. The accuracy of localization is then dependent on the separation distance between two-adjacent reference points and the transmission range of these reference points. Initial experimental results show that the accuracy for 90 percent of our data points is within one-third of the separation distance. However, future work is needed to extend the technique to more cluttered environments},

Besides using Mobile Broadband (MBB), there is a need to develop Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) applications with cellular networks especially when safety-related driving applications are concerned. Future cellular networks are expected to support novel latencysensitive use cases. Many applications of V2X communication, like collaborative autonomous driving requires very low latency and high reliability in order to support real-time communication between vehicles and other network elements. In this paper, we classify V2X use-cases and their requirements in order to identify cellular network technologies able to support them. The bottleneck problem of the medium access in 4G Long Term Evolution(LTE) networks is random access procedure. It is evaluated through simulations to further detail the future limitations and requirements. Limitations and improvement possibilities for next generation of cellular networks are finally detailed. Moreover, the results presented in this paper provide the limits of different parameter sets with regard to the requirements of V2X-based applications. In doing this, a starting point to migrate to Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) or 5G - solutions is given.},

In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. This survey paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LORa Alliance,WEIGHTLESS-SIG, and DASH7 Alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing the same limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.},

Users can now access efficient and convenient smart services in smart-city, green-IoT and heterogeneous networks. AI has been applied in various areas, including the intelligent household, advanced health-care, automatic driving and emotional interactions. This paper focuses on current wireless-communication technologies, including cellular-communication technologies (4G, 5G), low-power wide-area (LPWA) technologies with an unlicensed spectrum (LoRa, SigFox), and other LPWA technologies supported by 3GPP working with an authorized spectrum (EC-GSM, LTE-M, NB-IoT). We put forward a cognitive low-power wide-area-network (Cognitive-LPWAN) architecture to safeguard stable and efficient communications in a heterogeneous IoT. To ensure that the user can employ the AI efficiently and conveniently, we realize a variety of LPWA technologies to safeguard the network layer. In addition, to balance the demand for heterogeneous IoT devices with the communication delay and energy consumption, we put forward the AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method, starting from the perspective of traffic control. The AI algorithm provides the smart control of wireless-communication technology, intelligent applications and services for the choice of different wireless-communication technologies. As an example, we consider the AIWAC emotion interaction system, build the Cognitive-LPWAN and test the proposed AI-enabled LPWA hybrid method.

Narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) is one of the solutions introduced from 3rd Generation Partner Project (3GPP) Release-13 to fulfill this concept. Massive-connection and narrow band operation are two key features of NB-IoT. With current NB-IoT design, certain resources within narrow band are dedicated for transmitting paging information of massive connections. This leads to overload of the dedicated resources, and consequently increased padding bits and low resource efficiency. Moreover, UE power consumption would also rise due to the extra effort to decode larger packets. To solve above problems, a new resource allocation method is proposed, which includes a new definition of paging resource set and corresponding resource selection method. Link level simulation is conducted to show the benefit of our proposals.

abstract = {Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a new narrow-band radio technology introduced in the Third Generation Partnership Project release 13 to the 5th generation evolution for providing low-power wide-area IoT. In NB-IoT systems, repeating transmission data or control signals has been considered as a promising approach for enhancing coverage. Considering the new feature of repetition, link adaptation for NB-IoT systems needs to be performed in 2-D, i.e., the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and the repetition number. Therefore, existing link adaptation schemes without consideration of the repetition number are no longer applicable. In this paper, a novel uplink link adaptation scheme with the repetition number determination is proposed, which is composed of the inner loop link adaptation and the outer loop link adaptation, to guarantee transmission reliability and improve throughput of NB-IoT systems. In particular, the inner loop link adaptation is designed to cope with block error ratio variation by periodically adjusting the repetition number. The outer loop link adaptation coordinates the MCS level selection and the repetition number determination. Besides, key technologies of uplink scheduling, such as power control and transmission gap, are analyzed, and a simple single-tone scheduling scheme is proposed. Link-level simulations are performed to validate the performance of the proposed uplink link adaptation scheme. The results show that our proposed uplink link adaptation scheme for NB-IoT systems outperforms the repetition-dominated method and the straightforward method, particularly for good channel conditions and larger packet sizes. Specifically, it can save more than 14{\%} of the active time and resource consumption compared with the repetition-dominated method and save more than 46{\%} of the active time and resource consumption compared with the straightforward method.},

abstract = {The emergence of Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) has brought hope for the popularization and application of mobile Internet standards. Nowadays, NB-IoT technology has been introduced into the 3GPP standards, where low-overhead, low-data-transmission IoT devices can securely access the fifth Generation (5G) core network through the 3GPP access network. However, according to the current 3GPP standard, these NB-IoT devices still employ the traditional authentication process of normal User Equipment (UE) to implement mutual authentication between NB-IoT devices and 5G core networks, which brings a lot of communication and storage overhead, and it will be more serious when lots of NB-IoT devices are activated simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a fast mutual authentication and data transfer scheme for massive NB-IoT devices,which integrates the access authentication and secure data transmission process and achieves the authentications and data transmissions of a group of NB-IoT devices at the same time. Our scheme can not only greatly simplify the authentication process and alleviate the load of the networks, but also ensure robust security protection including user anonymity and non-repudiation. The performance analysis results show that the proposed scheme can withstand a variety of security attacks with ideal efficiency.},

GPS300 is available as Intellectual Property$\backslash$n(IP), which is integratable into cellular telephones and PDA's. It$\backslash$nis necessary to be able to measure the GPS signal indoors in order$\backslash$nto understand its structure and characteristics. The development$\backslash$nof the Indoor Signal Sensor (ISS) GPS receiver was completed for$\backslash$nthis purpose. This receiver uses two antenna's and two RF front ends.$\backslash$nOne antenna was placed outside or in a reference position allowing$\backslash$nGPS signals to be acquired by conventional techniques. The other$\backslash$nantenna was placed indoors at the location where the GPS signal was$\backslash$nto be characterized. Using the reference code and carrier from the$\backslash$ntracked (outside) signal, the code and carrier for the indoor signal$\backslash$ncould be generated, such that long integration periods could be achieved,$\backslash$nwith coherent signal integration, relative to the outside antenna.$\backslash$nTwelve physical channels were assigned to the indoor antenna, with$\backslash$nvariable and selectable code delays relative to the outdoor signal.$\backslash$nThis technique provided real-time measurements of indoor GPS signals,$\backslash$nfor multiple code delays, and for various coherent integration times.$\backslash$nThe fundamental "Integrate and Dump" correlation time was set to$\backslash$nbe 125 microseconds. Each code delay correlator sample of the indoor$\backslash$nsignal was normalized against the outside signal to remove the effects$\backslash$nof the 50 bits per second GPS data message. Each channel thus produced$\backslash$na relative code magnitude and carrier phase measurement. Internally,$\backslash$nsamples were accumulated over periods ranging from 1 millisecond$\backslash$nto 4 seconds. Longer integration times are simply a convenient method$\backslash$nof measuring the indoor GPS signal relative to the outside signal.$\backslash$nThe receiver was enabled to output the results both in real-time$\backslash$nand in a format suitable for post processing. The real-time output$\backslash$nconsisted of D/A outputs to drive a standard oscilloscope. The Y-axis$\backslash$nwas used to display signal magnitude, relative carrier phase and$\backslash$nraw I and Q correlator counts, verses the code delay on the X-axis.$\backslash$nActual video clips of the oscillator display are included in the$\backslash$naccompanying presentation of the paper. The video clips show the$\backslash$nconstitution of the GPS signal under several conditions including$\backslash$nstationary and slow moving antenna positions. The effects of multiple$\backslash$nsignal paths, standing waves, and the corresponding carrier phase$\backslash$nrelationships can be clearly seen. For more formal data collection,$\backslash$nsuitable for postprocessing, the receiver outputs text messages containing$\backslash$nraw correlator counts, or relative signal strength, for all code$\backslash$ndelays. This data is captured on a PC and processed by a variety$\backslash$nof means including Matlab and Excel to produce two and three dimensional$\backslash$nplots. To conclude, the results of several environments are illustrated$\backslash$nand discussed. The most important characteristics of indoor GPS signals$\backslash$nare identified. Examples of standing wave patterns, multiple signal$\backslash$npathways and general signal attenuation are given, and the optimum$\backslash$ncoherent and incoherent integrations times estimated.},

Concurrent operation is particularly seen as a means to achieve high spectral efficiency in the future IoT society. Although, under certain conditions, concurrent transmission may be possible without any modifications to the legacy Wi-Fi transceiver, we show that minimal adjustments to the Wi-Fi receiver can in fact lead to significant gains for the concurrent WB transmissions. Furthermore, if also the WB transmitter is aware of the scheduled overlay, small modifications to it can help improve the performance of the NB transmissions. Both these aspects are studied here in detail under various assumptions for the WB and NB transceivers.},

abstract = {In this paper, we consider positioning with observed-time-difference-of-arrival (OTDOA) for a device deployed in long-term-evolution (LTE) based narrow-band Internet-of-things (NB-IoT) systems. We propose an iterative expectation- maximization based successive interference cancellation (EM-SIC) algorithm to jointly consider estimations of residual frequency- offset (FO), fading-channel taps and time-of- arrival (ToA) of the first arrival-path for each of the detected cells. In order to design a low complexity ToA detector and also due to the limits of low-cost analog circuits, we assume an NB-IoT device working at a low-sampling rate such as 1.92 MHz or lower. The proposed EM-SIC algorithm comprises two stages to detect ToA, based on which OTDOA can be calculated. In a first stage, after running the EM-SIC block a predefined number of iterations, a coarse ToA is estimated for each of the detected cells. Then in a second stage, to improve the ToA resolution, a low-pass filter is utilized to interpolate the correlations of time-domain PRS signal evaluated at a low sampling-rate to a high sampling-rate such as 30.72 MHz. To keep low-complexity, only the correlations inside a small search window centered at the coarse ToA estimates are upsampled. Then, the refined ToAs are estimated based on upsampled correlations. If at least three cells are detected, with OTDOA and the locations of detected cell sites, the position of the NB-IoT device can be estimated. We show through numerical simulations that, the proposed EM-SIC based ToA detector is robust against impairments introduced by inter-cell interference, fading-channel and residual FO. Thus significant signal-to-noise (SNR) gains are obtained over traditional ToA detectors that do not consider these impairments when positioning a device.},

abstract = {This letter presents a dual-mode CMOS power amplifier (PA) that has an
improved efficiency using load-impedance modulation in the low-power

differential pair is turned ON, as a switch, to appropriately modulate
the load impedance for the transistor in the positive path using the
output balun. An external switch is deployed to turn VDD OFF for the
negative path. In order to verify the proposed concept, a dual-mode CMOS
PA IC was designed using a bulk CMOS process and an off-chip output
balun, and it was evaluated using the 920-MHz narrow-band Internet of
Things signal with a bandwidth of 200 kHz and a peak-to-average power
ratio of 5.7 dB. For the HPM, the implemented PA exhibited a gain of
24.1 dB, a power-added efficiency (PAE) of 44.3{\%}, and an adjacent

NB-IoT targets on supporting communications for small amount of data during a relatively long period of time (i.e., delay tolerant), which is one of the key features of IoT applications. Several studies have been conducted by some standard working groups to define the standards for NB-IoT. For example, the working group 3GPP aims to provide communication protocols with low energy consumption, good coverage penetration, and so on. Compared with the existing wireless communication protocols, less spectrum is allocated for NB-IoT. Thus, how to more efficiently use the resource/spectrum (i.e., resource allocation and scheduling) is one of the key issues. In this paper, we first describe the design of the physical layer for the downlink communication, especially the scheduling process. Secondly, we discuss the issues for resource allocation in NB-IoT while the delay requirement in the physical layer is satisfied. Thirdly, we discuss the open questions and possible solutions.},

Therefore, it has attracted attention of both academia and industry. In this paper, we present the NB-IoT development, and main characteristics and design objectives of NB-IoT according to 3GPP R13. In addition, we provide the review of related literatures about NB-IoT modeling and algorithm analysis. And we explain current problems of NB-IoT system-level modelling based on visualized simulation platform. Moreover, this study is devoted to construction of NB-IoT model based on OPNET and verification of its characteristics, such as wide coverage and high channel utilization. This study mainly considers NB-IoT model design and realization in terms of NB-IoT physical layer characteristics. We summarize the cor- related characteristics of NB-IoT uplink and downlink. Then we design and construct the NB-IoT model based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. Lastly, we use the constructed NB-IoT model for simulations and conduct an experiment on it using the LTE network with channel bandwidths of 3 MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz, 15 MHz and 20 MHz. The simulation results have verified the performance of NB-IoT, wherein uplink time delay is lower than 10 s, channel utilization is higher than that of LTE network, and coverage area is larger than LTE network.},

This frequency band, due to the large available bandwidth is very attractive for future and 5G wireless communication systems. The usage of OFDM at millimetre-wave (mmWaves) frequencies is severely affected by non-linearities of the Radio Frequency (RF) front-ends. The impact of impairments is evaluated, in terms of some of the most important key performance indicators, including spectral efficiency, power efficiency, required coding overhead and system complexity, Out-Of-Band Emissions (OOBEs), Bit Error Rate (BER) target and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Additionally, joint distortion effects of coexisting Phase-Noise (PN), mixer IQ imbalances and Power Amplifier (PA) non-linearities, on the performance degradation of a mmWave radio transceiver, combined with various multipath fading channels, are investigated. Subsequently, the power efficiency of the system is evaluated by estimating values of the PA Output-Power-Backoff (OBO) needed to meet the requirements for the Transmit Spectrum Mask (TSM) and BER target. Finally, a comparison of the system overall performance between uncoded and coded OFDM systems combined with Quadrature Amplitude Modulations (16 and 64 QAM) and its maximum operable range are evaluated by transmitting a Full HD uncompressed video frame under five different RF impairment conditions over a typical LOS kiosk 60 GHz IEEE channel model.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. Future fifth-generation (5G) cellular systems are set to give a strong boost to the large-scale deployment of Internet of things (IoT). In the view of a future converged 5G-IoT infrastructure, cellular IoT solutions such as narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) and device-to-device (D2D) communications are key technologies for supporting IoT scenarios and applications. However, some open issues still need careful investigation. An example is the risk of threats to privacy and security when IoT mobile services rely on D2D communications. To guarantee efficient and secure connections to IoT services involving exchange of sensitive data, reputation-based mechanisms to identify and avoid malicious devices are fast gaining ground. In order to tackle the presence of malicious nodes in the network, this paper introduces reliability and reputation notions to model the level of trust among devices engaged in an opportunistic hop-by-hop D2D-based content uploading scheme. To this end, social awareness of devices is considered as a means to enhance the identification of trustworthy nodes. A performance evaluation study shows that the negative effects due to malicious nodes can be drastically reduced by adopting the proposed solution. The performance metrics that proved to benefit from the proposed solution are data loss, energy consumption, and content uploading time.},

abstract = {A new function split option for the next generation fronthaul interface (NGFI) is demonstrated based on all-digital RF transmitter using bandpass delta-sigma modulation. Different from other low layer split (LLS) options, such as option 6 (MAC-PHY), 7 (high-low PHY), and 8 (CPRI), the proposed option 9 split implements RF functions in the digital domain, and splits within the RF layer, with high-RF layer centralized in the distributed unit (DU) and low-RF layer distributed in remote radio units (RRUs). A proof-of-concept all-digital RF transmitter based on real-time delta-sigma modulation is implemented using a Xilinx Virtex-7 FPGA. A 5-GSa/s delta-sigma modulator is demonstrated to encode LTE/5G signals with bandwidth up to 252 MHz and modulation format up to 1024-QAM to a 5-Gb/s OOK signal, which is transmitted over 30-km single-mode fiber from DU to RRU. To relax the FPGA speed requirement, a 32-pipeline architecture is designed. Two-carrier aggregation of 5G and 14-carrier aggregation of LTE signals are demonstrated with error vector magnitude (EVM) performance satisfying the 3GPP specifications. Compared with option 8 (CPRI), although the proposed option 9 split occurs at a lower level, it offers improved spectral efficiency and reduced NGFI data rate than CPRI. Moreover, other LLS options, such as 6, 7, 8, all require a complete RF layer implemented in the analog domain at remote cell sites; whereas option 9 realizes high-RF layer in the digital domain at DU, and eliminates the need of analog RF devices, e.g., DAC, local oscillator and mixer at RRU, which not only makes low-cost, energy-efficient, and small-footprint cell sites possible for the wide deployment of small cells, but also paves the road toward software defined radio (SDR) and virtualization of DU and RRU for improved compatibility and reconfigurability among multiple radio access technologies (multi-RATs). Given its centralized architecture and deterministic latency, option 9 is suitable for radio coordination applications, e.g., coordinated multipoint or joint Tx/Rx, and has potential in low-frequency narrowband scenarios with cost, power, and/or size sensitive cell sites, such as massive machine type communication (mMTC) and narrowband internet of things (NB-IoT).},

In the coming up 5G communication systems other than the traditional requirements for higher bandwidth for mobile communication, the massive connections and ultra-reliable and low-latency requirements are the new challenges to the 5G communication systems. Fog computing is considered a good solution to address the demand for massive connections and low-latency applications by pushing some computing or processing tasks from the cloud servers to the Fog nodes, or close to the mobile edge. A Fog node can be viewed as a reduced capability of a cloud server and/or integrated with a small cell for handling the telecommunication services. In this study, a Fog node system software is developed on an Arm 64-bit server grade SoC known as Green server. Several potential applications such as smart parking, smart home surveillance, and smart retail and delivery services are under investigation on such a system to demonstrate the requirements for massive connections and low latency can be met on the Fog computing node system environment.},

Comparing with traditional RF transmitter front-end based on single-bit $\Sigma$$\Delta$ modulators [3], our architecture can achieve about 23dB lower OOB (out-of-band) noise. Moreover, it can keep the linearity close to single-bit ones. So, complex and hardware intensive digital predistortion is no longer an essential. The post-simulation ACPR is 60dB for a 180KHz NB-IoT channel at 900MHz. The total power consumption is 9.4mW at 3.6GHz clock frequency with a supply voltage of 1V, and the total chip area is 0.71mm{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}.},

Combined with NB-IoT network and Power Line Carrier (PLC) communication, this solution realizes local intelligent control and remote supervision of LED street lights. During daytime when lights are normally off, if the light intensity sensor detects that the natural brightness is insufficient, lights will be turned on at a required level. During nighttime when lights are normally on, the on-demand lighting is achieved by the energy-saving algorithm described in this paper.

abstract = {In today's society fall has become a very serious issue and also a threat to older generation. Fall leads to major injuries, physical disability and sometimes death. Therefore, there is a need to design a dependable embedded system device which will help in detecting the fall and further sends an emergency notification and thus helps in preventing the fall. Many researchers have considered human fall as an unpredictable danger to the life of older generation. Hence lot of research has been done in this area to develop a fall detection system. The existing fall detection systems are efficient but they lack in sensor optimization, early fall detection and efficient wireless communication. In this study, we have demonstrated a pre-fall detection system which detects human falls approximately 250 ms before it occurs. Early fall detection helps in preventing the subject from serious injuries. The designed system monitors user balanced and unbalanced state. Once the unbalance state is detected the system signifies it as a fall, thus gives milliseconds of time to trigger the safety devices like wearable airbag worn by a subject. On fall the system sends emergency notification to the care taker using either Internet of things (IoT) or Bluetooth low energy (BLE). The Hardware system is designed such that it consumes low power and it is a dependable embedded system with easy to wear capabilities for the subject. The designed system uses Arm Processor associated with motion sensors, communication sensors, Signal sensor and MicroSD Card. The software and hardware combination was developed to get optimal low power consumption by switching the CPU between active and sleep mode. The practical experiments performed on the designed system results in giving the 100{\%} sensitivity and 98.07{\%} specificity for fall detection. The wireless communication is efficiently designed such that the power is consumed only when the fall is triggered. The designed system acknowledges the difference - etween activity of daily living (ADL) like walking, sitting running, and climbing stairs with actual fall.},

abstract = {The twelve articles in this special section focus on new and enabling technologies for smart Internet of Things (IoT). IoT supports ubiquitous information exchange and content sharing among smart devices with little or no human intervention, is a key enabler for various applications. Smart IoT cannot be simply regarded as an upgrade of current IoT by just adding to or replacing sensors/actuators/RFID tags in smart devices. It should be redesigned from the physical layer to the application layer in a bottom-up way. While the traditional-sense IoT paradigm, including the present narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) proposal, aims to provide low-rate, short-range, and relatively stationary connections to the wireless sensors and/or RFID tags, the new architecture is expected to support higher data rates, longer communication ranges, and more flexible mobility for smart devices, with the assistance of some new caching, communication, and computing technologies. These also enable smart IoT to be applied to a broader application area including crowdsensing, crowdsourcing, AR/VR, UAV, and so on, to realize smarter cities, grid, and health, and more intelligent transportation systems. Fully utilizing the communication, computing, caching, and security technologies can essentially complement the current development of IoT.The resulting new structure may have a wider application over current infrastructure-based cellular networks and traditional sensor-based networks by adopting all these features.},

Considering the narrow bandwidth character of NB-IoT system, the simulation result would be over-optimistic if the evaluation method about ACLR and ACS in coexistence study of LTE system is still used. In this paper, a new evaluation method about ACLR and ACS is proposed aimed at NB-IoT system, which takes the huge difference of system bandwidth between NB-IoT and LTE system into account. When LTE is the victim system, if the throughput loss does not exceed 5{\%}, LTE and NB-IoT system could coexist. When NB-IoT is the victim system, if the SINR loss is minor compared with the result that without coexistence, NB-IoT and LTE system could coexist. The simulation results show that the NB-IoT system could coexist with LTE system when NB-IoT BS ACS is about 45dB and UE ACLR is in the range of 40{\~{}}45dB.},

The general objectives of NB-IoT include of supporting massive connections, enhanced coverage, reduced cost and complexity, ultra-low power consumption and flexible delay characteristics. To lower energy consumption while providing reliable connections, extended discontinuous reception (eDRX) and power saving mode (PSM) mechanism are applied in NB-IoT. To evaluate the energy consumption and delay performance under periodic uplink reporting, which is common among cellular IoT applications, this paper develops a semi- Markov chain with four states, namely, PSM, ilde, random access (RACH) and transmission (Tx) states. RACH and Tx states are introduced from the well-known CONNECTED STATE to account for the extra power consumed due to increased access collisions under massive synchronous connections. Furthermore, an optimization model introduced to find the best PSM duration which is configured to minimize energy consumption and average delay according to user's preference. Numerical results show that, setting higher limits for the number of possible RACH request transmission can make user equipment (UE) more tolerant to delay and energy consumption in massively deployed concurrent communications UEs. Extending the PSM duration to longer period will cause excessive increase in delay without much impact on energy saving improvement.},

These applications are characterized by massive connections from a large number of low-complexity and low-power devices. One of the goals of NB-IoT is to improve coverage extension beyond existing cellular technologies. In order to do that, NB-IoT introduces transmission repetitions and different bandwidth allocation configurations in uplink. These new transmission approaches yield many transmission options in uplink. In this paper, we propose analytical expressions that describe the influence of these new approaches in the transmission. Our analysis is based on the Shannon theorem. The transmission is studied in terms of the required Signal to Noise Ratio, bandwidth utilization, and energy per transmitted bit. Additionally, we propose an uplink link adaptation algorithm that contemplates these new transmission approaches. The conducted evaluation summarizes the influence of these approaches. Furthermore, we present the resulting uplink link adaptation from our proposed algorithm sweeping the device's coverage.},

abstract = {Low power and long range machine-to-machine (M2M) communication techniques are expected to provide ubiquitous connections for the wireless devices. In this paper, three major low power and long range M2M solutions are surveyed. The first type of solutions is referred to as the low power wide area (LPWA) network. The design of the LPWA techniques features low cost, low data rate, long communication range, and low power consumption. The second type of solutions is the IEEE 802.IIah which features higher data rates using a wider bandwidth than the LPWA-based solutions. The third type of solutions is operated under the cellular network infrastructure. Based on the analysis of the pros and cons of the enabling technologies of the surveyed M2M solutions, as well as the corresponding deployment strategies, the gaps in knowledge are identified. The paper also presents a summary of the research directions for improving the performance of the surveyed low power and long range M2M communication technologies.},

abstract = {Due to the heterogeneous and resource-constrained characters of Internet of Things (IoT), how to guarantee ubiquitous network connectivity is challenging. Although LTE cellular technology is the most promising solution to provide network connectivity in IoTs, information diffusion by cellular network not only occupies its saturating bandwidth, but also costs additional fees. Recently, NarrowBand-IoT (NB-IoT), introduced by 3GPP, is designed for low-power massive devices, which intends to refarm wireless spectrum and increase network coverage. For the sake of providing high link connectivity and capacity, we stimulate effective cooperations among user equipments (UEs), and propose a social-aware group formation framework to allocate resource blocks (RBs) effectively following an in-band NB-IoT solution. Specifically, we first introduce a social-aware multihop device-to-device (D2D) communication scheme to upload information toward the eNodeB within an LTE, so that a logical cooperative D2D topology can be established. Then, we formulate the D2D group formation as a scheduling optimization problem for RB allocation, which selects the feasible partition for the UEs by jointly considering relay method selection and spectrum reuse for NB-IoTs. Since the formulated optimization problem has a high computational complexity, we design a novel heuristic with a comprehensive consideration of power control and relay selection. Performance evaluations based on synthetic and real trace simulations manifest that the presented method can significantly increase link connectivity, link capacity, network throughput, and energy efficiency comparing with the existing solutions.},

abstract = {Smart urban drainage systems (SUDS) with real-time control are considered to be one of the prominent approaches to tackle the impact of climate change which results in heavy rainfall and floods in urban areas. However, the lack of reliable and efficient communication with sensors buried underground is considered as one of the main deficiencies preventing ubiquitous application of SUDS. With the recent developments of new noise insensitive technologies for ultra-narrow band (UNB) and chirp spread spectrum (CSS) communication, introducing new low-power long-range communication technologies (e.g. NB-IoT, LoRa), implementation of such drainage systems is becoming feasible. This paper presents a comparative study of NB-IoT and LoRa and evaluate the potential of these technologies to be used for SUDS. The study is conducted in different underground scenarios such as dry and damp conditions to highlight the potential benefits offered by LoRa and NB-IoT in terms of coverage, information rate, and energy consumption. It has been shown through the simulation results that NB-IoT offers capillary coverage with a high level of scalability as compared to LoRa. Furthermore, NB-IoT also provide high information rate and low energy consumption and is best suited for underground scenarios.},

abstract = {To meet the requirements of long range, a small amount of data transmission, low power, and low cost of the Internet of Things (IoT) in actual applications, a Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) information monitoring approach based on NB-IoT and LoRa is proposed in this paper. This approach adopts a communication mode that contains a main node and multiple subnodes to adapt to the needs of large-scale information monitoring. Among them, the design of the main node utilizes NB-IoT communication technology, LoRa communication technology, and LRU algorithm. The design of subnode utilizes LoRa communication technology, sensor technology, and optical-electric conversion technology. Finally, we design and implement a cloud service and computing system, using the Tencent Cloud server. The advantage of this approach is that the combination of NB-IoT and LoRa not only improves transmission distance but also reduces the operating costs of the WAN information monitoring system. In addition, using optical-electric conversion technology, the system can be self-powered. Combined with the principle of electric circuits, the power consumption of the system can also be reduced. Finally, by conducting a system test, LoRa communication distance experiment, NB-IoT communication, and other experiments, the communication distance in a complex environment is up to 1.6 km, the minimum working current is 2 mA, and the system communication packet loss rate is approximately 3{\%}. The system runs stably and the collected data are accurate. The results show that the proposed approach can meet the requirements of data collection, transmission, storage, and calculation in a wide area.},

abstract = {Rapid hypoxia of the aquaculture water is one of the important factors that cause large area death of the aquaculture animals. The monitoring for the dissolved oxygen (DO) of the aquaculture water is very important to the safety of the aquaculture production. An intelligent monitoring system for DO of the aquaculture water is designed which provides a powerful technology method for maintaining the DO level of the aquaculture water in a good range. The optical and polarographic DO sensor, the NB-IoT low-power and narrow-band communication technology and the programmable logic controller (PLC) technology are used to build this system which realizes the full-automatic and intelligent monitoring for DO of the aquaculture water. A continuous monitoring test for DO of the experiment Kio pond is made while the DO standard is set between 5 to 8mg/L in summer. Analyzing result from the data records of the system and the artificial sampling shows that the response time of the system reaches 5.92s. The system can control the circuit breaker of the oxygen-increasing machine intelligently without the human intervention. The system can also send the alarm message and feedback the working status of the oxygen-increasing device to the aquaculture manager and technician. The result shows that the system can replace the traditional artificial DO monitoring and the field control mode of the aquaculture water, while reducing the daily workload and power consumption of the oxygen-increasing machine effectively. The system can realize the intelligent 24-hour security monitoring for the DO level of the aquaculture water.},

abstract = {Most indoor navigation technologies need to provide structure maps of buildings, but it is difficult to obtain these structure maps in practice. Therefore, we design a geomagnetism based indoor navigation system without structure map of buildings by applying offloading strategy in Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT). Why the geomagnetic signal can be used to achieve indoor navigation is due to its stability. We divide the indoor navigation into two parts: the construction of signal fingerprint database and the user navigation. Firstly, the navigator carries out the signal acquisition of navigation route, and transfers the original signals to cloud server so as to construct the fingerprint database. Secondly, users can choose online navigation or offline navigation according to the actual situation. When choosing offline navigation, the users will employ dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm for fingerprint matching. When users would like to obtain better navigation results, they can choose online navigation. In this case, navigation system will offload the users' sampling data to remote cloud, and then the cloud matches the fingerprint of geomagnetic signals by using particle filter (PF) algorithm and sends the computation results to the users so as to indicate the users' moving direction. Experiment results demonstrate that our method is effective and the turning error is only 5 centimeters.},

We compare detection probabilities for the NPSS and NSSS, i.e., PCID using the proposed frequency domain PVS transmit diversity schemes to those using the conventional time domain PVS transmit diversity scheme based on link-level simulations. The computer simulation results show that both the distributed and localized PVS transmit diversity schemes achieve almost the identical PCID detection probability to that of the time domain PVS transmit diversity scheme under a small frequency offset condition.},

Even so, most of the MNOs are now facing with the challenges of adopting the most suitable LP-WAN technology within their network infrastructures. Some of the emerging LP-WAN technologies can complement already existing infrastructure of MNOs or they can be built using a separate infrastructure.

Additionally, we provide an analysis of utilizing different LP-WAN technologies with respect to their possible integration with vertical industries.},

abstract = {In this simulation work the coverage of GPRS, Narrowband-IoT, LoRa, and SigFox is compared in a realistic scenario, covering 7800 km2 and using Telenor's commercial 2G, 3G, and 4G deployment. The target is to evaluate which of the four technologies provides the best coverage for Internet of Things devices, which may be located deep indoor. The results show that Narrowband-IoT, having the best Maximum Coupling Loss performance of 164 dB, also provides the best coverage. This is despite the fact that LoRa and SigFox deployments with omnidirectional antennas are found to provide 3 dB lower link loss on average. In the deployment 11 {\%} of the geographical area contains devices, located both in rural and urban areas. The NB-IoT has an outage below 1 {\%} for locations experiencing 20 dB indoor penetration loss in addition to the outdoor path loss. SigFox performs similarly, while LoRa cannot provide coverage for 2 {\%} of those locations. For the challenging deep indoor case, where 30 dB additional penetration loss is expected, NB-IoT has 8 {\%} outage while SigFox and LoRa is unable to cover 13 {\%} and 20 {\%} of the locations. The four technologies may not be deployed at all existing site locations and therefore the work also includes a study of the coverage as a function of the minimum Inter-Site Distance, where sites closer than 2, 4, and 6 km are filtered out. The results show that SigFox and NB-IoT have outage probabilities below 5 {\%} even though sites closer than 4 km are removed from the simulations.},

abstract = {The term low-power, wide-area (LPWA) may be relatively new, but the concept of low-cost, low- power connectivity has been around for a while with other names: Machine-to-Machine (M2M), Wireless Sensor Networking (WSN), Internet-of- Things (IoT), etc. There is a clear market need for ubiquitous, battery-efficient, professionally managed, and out-of-the-box connectivity to unlock massive value for tens to hundreds of billions of devices. In this document, we explore the power of a technically unconstrained and customer-driven development process to create a disruptive technology, how that process created Random Phase Multiple Access (RPMA{\textregistered}), and many of the fundamental design considerations that uniquely address these tens, and ultimately hundreds of billions of devices. This Executive Summary is intended for a wide audience and everyone is encouraged to read the full document. Those that have some familiarity with wireless technology or wireless development will likely understand the differentiation of RPMA. Those who would like to drill deeply into the claims surrounding RPMA are encouraged to look closely at the appendices of this document where we go into a significant amount of detail.},

abstract = {Many wireless short packet systems have been recently proposed because of new emerging use-cases in wireless communications. These competing schemes exhibit quite different design choices, at least from the physical layer perspective. An interesting question arising is whether there would be a particular waveform that could best fit the short length requirements in terms of transmission rate. In this paper, we focus on four short packet modulation schemes that are Ultra Narrowband (UNB), Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) and CP-OFDM. We propose a discrete model for CSS modulation and compare the best achievable transmission rates of the four modulation schemes for multi-user transmissions over block fading channels.},

abstract = {Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a radio access technology standardized by the 3GPP to support a large set of use cases for massive machine-type communications. Compared to human-oriented 4G technologies, NB-IoT has key design features in terms of increased coverage, enhanced power saving, and a reduced set of functionalities. These features allow for connectivity of devices in challenging positions, enabling long battery life and reducing device complexity. This article provides a detailed overview on NB-IoT, together with analysis and performance evaluation of the technology. Both uplink and downlink directions are presented, including recent updates on the support of multicast transmissions. The article summarizes the possible configurations of NB-IoT, discusses the procedures for data transmission and reception, and analyzes aspects such as latency and resource occupation. We present a performance evaluation focusing on both uplink and downlink, with the aim to understand the channel occupancy of NB-IoT for different real-life IoT use cases and cell deployments. Further analysis focuses on the impact of various radio access parameters on the capacity of NB-IoT. Finally, results focusing on a new use case for NB-IoT (i.e., firmware update of a group of devices) are presented in the form of a comparison between unicast and multicast transmission modes.},

New challenges such as very low data-rates are associated to these new technologies. This work shows that the combination of limited low-power communications and low-cost microcontrollers does not necessarily mean that simple, suboptimal strategies should be used to operate the cyber-physical-systems on which IoT devices are installed such as smart buildings and smart cities. In particular, predictive approaches based on numerical optimization, efficiently implemented on low-cost microcontrollers, counteract some of the shortcomings of low-power communication technologies and can enable the full potential of the internet of things. We present how low-power, low-cost solutions running advanced control and operation algorithms could be deployed and show the advantages of the proposed idea using Sigfox communication and simulation results for the temperature control of a smart building.},

abstract = {Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a cellular based IoT technique, which can send messages at a long distance using repetitive transmission and single tone frequency hopping. However, retuning of the RF frontend for each narrowband hop could cause frequency offset. Since each tone is shaped by a sinc pulse, when combining tones into a complete signal at the receiver, the side lobe of the sinc pulse would result in significant signal interference in the frequency offset condition. In this work, we propose a half-sinc (HS) waveform for uplink channels via cutting half band using the Hilbert transform to intentionally reserve a frequency offset protection gap. It is verified that the half-sinc waveform can tolerate up to 100{\%} frequency offset via simulation and can practically remove the half side signal band in a software defined IoT platform.},

This limitation makes it difficult for necessary stakeholders to determine parties at fault, especially when future operations are expected to be conducted Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight (BVLoS). While both on-board and off-board recorders currently exist, the data collected is unsuitable for insurance claims and other legal matters since non-repudiation and tamper-proof mechanisms are not implemented. At the same time, with ongoing developments and improvements to Internet of Things (IoT) telecommunications infrastructure such as LTE-M, 5G, SigFox and NB-IoT protocols, usage of TCP/IP channels and cloud services for UAV Command and Control systems is increasing. This research proposes a real-time, off-board flight logging service using a secure graph database scheme for storage and analysis of flight data recordings. By representing series of logs as an encrypted block chain in graph nodes of a database, it is possible to construct accurate time-lines and enable non-repudiation of operator-UAV and UAV-UAV interactions that provide irrefutable evidence. For proof of concept, this design integrates into the UAV as a Service architecture for BVLOS operations we have proposed in previous publications.

Impact on various soil properties like EC, pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), available phosphorus, exchangeable K, Na, Ca, Cl, microbial population and soil enzyme activities were studied. Long term application of PME proved useful in significantly increasing TOC, TKN, K, P and soil enzymatic activities in the soil but tended to build up harmful concentration of Na, that could be chelated by bioamendments. In short terms studies, application of 50{\%} PME along with bioamendments proved to be the most useful in improving the properties of sodic soil and also favoured successful germination and improved seedling growth of pearl millet.},

abstract = {As of today, the machine-to-machine and Internet of Things (IoT) markets have significantly benefited from the deployment of diverse and efficient terrestrial low-power wide area networks (LPWAN) thanks to technologies such as SIGFOX UNB, LoRa, or NB-IoT. To further increase the coverage of such networks to remote areas, a satellite-based network with close interconnection to a terrestrial one is required. In this brief, we show the feasibility of a satellite link based on system and technological concepts similar to those used for LPWAN. We additionally prove the possibility of integrating the terminal transceiver in a single CMOS IC with power consumption and cost of the same order of magnitude as the terrestrial one. To this end, a complete L-band transceiver has been implemented. The transmitter modulates 400 symbols/s QPSK signals at as high as +12 dBm output power for 22.4 mA consumption under 3.3 V. The receiver consumes 4.7 mA while detecting the presence of low Earth orbit satellite pilots and demodulating the 20 ksymbols/s QPSK signal with -112 dBm sensitivity. The baseband processing handles up to 40 kHz Doppler shift and +/ - 440 Hz/s Doppler drift. The IC is processed in 65-nm CMOS technology from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited.},

It has broad application potentials in the IoT market. Network performance evaluation facilitates the deployment of NB-IoT devices and system optimization. In this paper, we model the data flow arrival process and service process of NB-IoT under different distributions individually and propose a method to analyze the access delay bounds in NB-IoT utilizing stochastic network calculus. Simulations show that this method can predict the system delay under uniform distribution reasonably and effectively. For the case where massive IoT devices access simultaneously following the Beta distribution, we propose two optimization strategies: region clustering and dynamic service rate adjustment. The optimized NB-IoT access model can reduce the network congestion caused by the simultaneous access of all devices significantly, and improve network performance when a large number of devices try to access, which can be used to guarantee the QoS of the NB-IoT access networks.},

In NB-IoT systems, the number of connected IoT devices will be explosively increased and how to efficiently use radio resources of NB-IoT systems to achieve massive connections is an important issue. However, since the downlink radio access strategy designed for NB-IoT systems needs to be performed in one dimension (i.e., time domain), we observe that inappropriate scheduling decisions will result in radio resource waste. In this paper, we introduce the NB-IoT radio access strategy in detail and study the NB-IoT scheduling problem. The objective is to minimize the used radio resource while each device''s data requirement can be satisfied. Then, we formulate the NB-IoT scheduling problem and propose an efficient algorithm. The simulation results evaluate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm and provide useful insights into the scheduling design for NB-IoT systems.},

abstract = {Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is widely used in low power wide area network (LPWAN) applications due to its long distance coverage and low power consumption. According to the 3GPP NB-IoT standard, the maximum modulation format that NB-IoT can support is QPSK, which limits the data rate sensitive IoT applications. To overcome this limitation either higher order modulation formats such as 8PSK or advanced non-orthogonal signal waveforms can be used. In this work, we propose an enhanced NB-IoT framework, eNB-IoT, which applies a non-orthogonal spectrally efficient frequency division multiplexing (SEFDM) signal waveform beyond the typical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Since the uplink signal recovery is at base station (BS), in this work we use an efficient and sophisticated minimum Euclidean norm search detector, termed sphere decoding (SD) detector. Simulation results indicate that to achieve the same data rate improvement (i.e. 50{\%} improvement) and BER performance, eNB-IoT, employing the non-orthogonal signal waveform, requires 3 dB less transmission power than typical NB-IoT using the dense modulation approach at{\textless}tex{\textgreater}{\$}\backslashtext{\{}BER{\}}=10{\^{}}{\{}-5{\}}{\$}{\textless}/tex{\textgreater}. The saved power can either extend the battery life of IoT devices or extend the signal transmission distance. This work also proposes an overlapped SD (OSD) detector to simplify the BS signal processing. Its parallel architecture, employing multiple small size SD kernels, can speed up the signal detection. Results show that by using the OSD detector, eNB-IoT still outperforms NB-IoT but with one order of magnitude complexity reduction.},

Meanwhile, channel state infor- mation (CSI), as a promising positioning characteristic, has been gradually adopted as an enhanced channel metric in indoor positioning schemes. In this paper, we propose a CSI ampli- tude fingerprinting-based localization algorithm in Narrowband Internet of Things system, in which we optimize a centroid algo- rithm based on CSI propagation model. In particular, in the fingerprint matching, we utilize the method of multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis to calculate the Euclidean distance and time-reversal resonating strength between the target point and the reference points and then employ the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm for location estimation. By conjugate gradient method, moreover, we optimize the localization error of triangu- lar centroid algorithm and combine the positioning result with MDS and KNN's estimated position to get the final estimated position. Experiment results show that compared to some exist- ing localization methods, our proposed algorithm can effectively reduce positioning error. Index},

abstract = {Filtered orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (F-OFDM) system is a promising waveform for 5G and beyond to enable the multi-service system and spectrum efficient network slicing. However, the performance for F-OFDM systems has not been systematically analyzed in the literature. In this paper, we first establish a mathematical model for an F-OFDM system and derive the conditions to achieve the interference-free one-tap channel equalization. In the practical cases (e.g., insufficient guard interval, asynchronous transmission, and so on), the analytical expressions for inter-symbol interference, inter-carrier interference, and adjacent-carrier interference are derived, where the last term is considered as one of the key factors for asynchronous transmissions. Based on the framework, an optimal power compensation matrix is derived to make all of the subcarriers having the same ergodic performance. Another key contribution of this paper is that we propose a multi-rate F-OFDM system to enable low-complexity low-cost communication scenarios, such as narrow-band Internet of Things, at the cost of generating inter-subband interference (ISubBI). Low computational complexity algorithms are proposed to cancel the ISubBI. The result shows that the derived analytical expressions match the simulation results, and the proposed ISubBI cancelation algorithms can significantly save the original F-OFDM complexity (up to 100 times) without significant performance loss.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 VDE VERLAG GMBH. Applications and services emerged in the Internet of Things era are introducing new challenging requirements to the current communication technologies. Since a high number of devices are intentioned to sporadically send small data packets, the transmission speed goes at a secondary level of importance. Instead, more attention is devoted to coverage, computational complexity, and energy constraints. In this context, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project is complementing existing mobile systems with a novel technology, namely NarrowBand Internet of Things (NB-IoT), which is expected to be more suitable for Internet of Things scenarios. While it is getting more and more attention from academia and industry, there is an increasing need to have flexible instruments for designing and testing protocols and algorithms for the NB-IoT stack. To this end, the work discussed herein proposes an open source simulator for NB-IoT, conceived starting from the well-known LTE-Sim tool. At the present stage, it implements uplink transmission with both Single-Tone and Multi-Tone configurations, random access procedure, and baseline scheduling, while offering the support for multi carrier, stand alone, in band, and guard band operating modes. The tool has been used for evaluating the performance of reference NB-IoT scenarios. Obtained results highlight the impact of traffic load and system configurations on network performance.},

abstract = {Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and mobile edge computing (MEC) have been emerging as promising techniques in narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) systems to provide ubiquitously connected IoT devices with efficient transmission and computation. However, the successive interference cancellation (SIC) ordering of NOMA has become the bottleneck limiting the performance improvement for the uplink transmission, which is the dominant traffic flow of NB-IoT communications. Also, in order to guarantee the fairness of task execution latency across NB-IoT devices, the computation resource of MEC units has to be fairly allocated to tasks from IoT devices according to the task size. For these reasons, we investigate the joint optimization of SIC ordering and computation resource allocation in this paper. Specifically, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem with the objective to minimize the maximum task execution latency required per task bit across NB-IoT devices under the limitation of computation resource. We prove the NP-hardness of this joint optimization problem. To tackle this challenging problem, we first propose an optimal algorithm to obtain the optimal SIC ordering and computation resource allocation in two stages: the convex computation resource allocation optimization followed by the combinatorial SIC ordering optimization. To reduce the computational complexity, we design an efficient heuristic algorithm for the SIC ordering optimization. As a good feature, the proposed low-complexity algorithm suffers a negligible performance degradation in comparison with the optimal algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of NOMA in reducing the task execution latency.},

We introduce a model for calculating the energy consumption and study the effect of clock drift and propose a method to overcome it. We also propose a model for analytically evaluating the latency and the maximum number of devices in a network. Furthermore, we implement the main functionalities of both technologies and simulate the end-to-end latency and the maximum number of devices in a discrete-event network simulator NS-3. Numerical results show that 8 years battery life time can be achieved by both technologies in a poor coverage scenario and that depending on the coverage conditions and data length, one technology consumes less energy than the other.

The initial section describes the background of the GSM radio access technology, highlighting the suitability of an evolved GSM design to support the Cellular IoT (CIoT) core requirements, which includes ubiquitous coverage, ultra-low-device cost, and energy efficient device operation. The following sections builds from the ground up, starting with the physical layer, going through fundamental design choices such as frame structure, modulation, and channel coding. After the physical layer is covered, the basic procedures for support of full system operation are covered, including, for example, system access, paging functionality, and for EC-GSM-IoT-improved security protocols. The reader will not only have a good knowledge of EC-GSM-IoT after reading the chapter but will also have a basic understanding of what characteristics a system developed for CIoT should possess. At the end, a look at the latest enhancements of the EC-GSM-IoT design is presented.},

The applications are indoor/outdoor environment conditions monitoring (such as PM2.5, temperature, and humidity), emergency buttons, and so on. This paper uses PM2.5 measurement application as an example to present the performance of LoRa when it is used on campus. We investigated the LoRa transmission performance from LoRa end-devices to the LoRa gateway. We show how packet losses were affected by the distance between the end-device and the gateway, the transmit power, the payload length, the antenna angle, the time of day, and the weather conditions. The pattern of LoRa packet losses were also measured and we found that in our long-term PM2.5 monitoring application, more than 99{\%} of LoRa packet losses occurred with three or less consecutive packet losses.},

abstract = {In narrow band-Internet of Things (NB-IoT) systems, a preamble of physical random access channel (NPRACH) is based on a single-tone waveform combined with frequency hopping, which is appropriate to achieve the goals of IoT, such as long battery lifetime and extended coverage. Since the hopping pattern of a preamble is predetermined, it is possible to estimate time-of-arrival (ToA) using phase difference. The accurate ToA is very important for device positioning and uplink signal decoding. In this paper, we design a new frequency hopping pattern of NPRACH preamble which fully utilizes all feasible hopping distances for a given number of subcarriers in NPRACH. The proposed hopping pattern maintains the compatibility with the standard system, by keeping the NPRACH structure in standard with minimal change. The simulation results show that the proposed hopping pattern greatly improves the accuracy of ToA estimation without additional system overhead.},

abstract = {Massive M2M (Machine-to-Machine) Communications has been envisioned as a corner stone for next-generation 5G Communications. In addition, LTE has been evolving to accommodate increasing number of IoT devices with Machine Type Communications (also known as LTE-M) and Narrow-Band IOT (NB-IOT). Current cellular network systems are originally engineered for human-to-human communications. So the system allocates major portion of the radio resource to transmit the data packets. However, when devices with different traffic types access the LTE network, this might be a problem. For example, when massive M2M devices access the LTE network, the overhead of control signals might be too high for the system to support. Previous cellular M2M research focused mostly on control signaling in the first step of network entry process (i.e. RACH procedure). Nevertheless, a more complete study on the control signaling overhead for massive M2M devices need to be investigated. There are multiple control signaling steps and several types of channel resources are consumed when an idle state device enters active state. System bottleneck might happen in any of these steps. An inter-channel dynamic resource allocation method is proposed to improve the efficiency of control signaling and to reduce the control signaling storm caused by massive M2M devices. The proposed model estimates the traffic and calculates the demand on each channel. Reallocating of these channel resources leads to efficient resource utilization and thus the system could serve a greater number of M2M devices. In this paper, the investigation is conducted under LTE control plane procedure. Nevertheless, the same design principle could be applied to future 5G M2M.},

The smartwatch has several functionalities; the most important are automatic fall detection, SOS button, communication with carers, location detection in case of emergency, and general activity monitoring. The smartwatch communicates with the server via GSM, therefore it does not depend on wireless internet or Bluetooth connection. The tablet acts as a virtual doorman and also as an interface for the carer, while the portal acts as a central information hub for notifications, scheduling of tasks, and user overview.

abstract = {Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is a new technology being implemented into the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standards to support machine-to-machine communications. Applications of IoT are expected to rapidly increase and to expand into many sectors. Increased number of IoT devices trying to access the medium with typically small data packets will overwhelm the network. Cognitive radios coupled with random access strategies can help alleviate excessive collisions in the network by many IoT access attempts. On the other hand, most IoT devices do not have hardware capabilities to perform sophisticated spectrum sensing methods over long durations. Therefore, it is important to reduce the spectrum sensing overhead while maximizing the NB-IoT network level throughput. In this paper, we derive a unique set of optimal sensing parameters which achieve the maximum throughput of a narrowband cognitive radio IoT (NB-CR-IoT) network. We show that accurate sensing from a single device perspective is not always the best solution for maximizing the throughput in an NB-CR-IoT network.},

Although it natively promises an impressive battery lifetime to constrained devices, advanced methodologies that further reduce energy consumptions are still required. To this aim, this work investigates an extended NB-IoT architecture, embracing the cooperative relaying paradigm. It formulates an optimal relay selection algorithm that minimizes the overall amount of energy consumed in a NB-IoT cell. In addition, it proposes a greedy algorithm able to reach the same goal with a lower computational complexity. System level simulations clearly demonstrate that the adoption of the proposed cooperative relaying paradigm brings to an energy saving up to 30{\%}. Moreover, the greedy approach registers energy consumptions which are only 10{\%} higher than the optimal strategy.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) is seen as a set of vertical application domains that share a limited number of common basic functionalities. In this view, consumer-centric solutions, platforms, data management, and business models have to be developed and consolidated in order to deploy effective solutions in the specific fields. The availability of low-cost general-purpose processing and storage systems with sensing/actuation capabilities coupled with communication capabilities are broadening the possibilities of IoT, leading to open systems that will be highly programmable and virtualized, and will support large numbers of application programming interfaces (APIs). IoT emerges as a set of integrated technologies ? new, exciting solutions and services that are set to change the way people live and produce goods. IoT is regarded by many as a fruitful technological sector in order to generate revenues. IoT covers a large wealth of consumer-centric technologies and is applicable to an even larger set of application domains. Innovation will be nurtured and driven by the possibilities offered by the combination of increased technological capabilities, new business models, and the rise of new ecosystems.

abstract = {This letter presents a wideband digital power amplifier (DPA) with Class-G technique to enhance back-off efficiency for Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications. The switched-capacitor power amplifier topology is adopted for high linearity performance. A wideband matching network is proposed to achieve 0.54-0.95-GHz frequency coverage for 802.11ah and narrowband IoT standards. The measurement results demonstrate a flat frequency response with only 0.5-dB power deviation over 0.54-0.95 GHz. The DPA achieves the peak output power of 23.5 dBm with 42.7{\%} peak PAE and 32.8{\%} PAE at 6-dB back off. When amplifying an 8-MHz 64 quadratic-amplitude modulation 802.11ah signal at 800 MHz, it obtains -28.4-dB error vector magnitude and 30.1{\%} average PAE at 16.5-dBm average output power.},

abstract = {Machine Type Communications (MTC) is one of the prominent solutions to enable the Internet of Things (IoT). With a large number of IoT applications envisioned over the cellular network, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has initiated the support for MTC in the Long Term Evolution (LTE)/ LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) standards. A significant portion of the MTC devices is expected to be low-complexity and low-power User Equipment (UE), requiring an energy efficient mode of operation. In addition, many such UEs can be located in the regions of low network coverage. In this paper, we show that an accurate estimation and compensation of the residual carrier frequency offset (CFO) at the base-station (eNB) results in a reduction in energy consumption for MTC devices in low coverage. For robust and accurate CFO estimation in low coverage, we propose a Maximum Likelihood (ML) based CFO estimation technique that works for data and/or pilot repetitions in LTE/LTE-A uplink. Through simulations, we illustrate that our technique shows a significant performance improvement over the conventional CFO estimation technique using the phase angle of the correlation between the repeated data. We determine that residual CFO estimation and compensation at the eNB results in 22.5{\%}-55.2{\%} reduction in energy consumption of the MTC devices, when compared to the case without CFO compensation.},

abstract = {In this paper, a smart wearable health monitoring technology is presented with the GPS tracking ability for the children with autism. The main problem faced by the parents of an autistic child is to regular monitor the health condition of their children. An autistic child may have several health issues and requires constant monitoring of heart rate, pulse and body temperature but it is quite tough for parents and caretaker to measure health parameters regulary. Another acute problem is to keep tracking of the location of an autistic child whenever he or she is outside of the home without parents or caretakers. Conventional tracking devices have the limitation of small battery life. To overcome these problems, a wearable device is proposed which will be able to measure the temperature and pulse of the child and send notification with detailed information to the parents. The device will be able to detect the coordinates of it's user. Parents will have the ability to set parameters for a specific region of area. The device will send the coordinates of the child with regular notification and emergency alerts will be immediately notified whenever the pulse rate or temperature varies more or less than the standard value and whenever the child will be detected out of predefined coordinates. A wearable solar charging unit is proposed to overcome the limitation of small battery life so that the device will be always charged up whenever the child is traveling or outside of home.},

As the currently used energy measurement in watthour meters is related to the grid voltage zero crossing, the trigger to start synchronous measurement has to be delivered through the data communication channel with the precision not less than the mains fundamental period. The data communication channels which play a significant role in the advanced measurement infrastructure, namely power line carrier, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT and WiFi are considered in this paper. The method of remote meter instructing to start energy measurement, while the real measurement will be initiated on the first upcoming mains zero crossing is analyzed. The assessment of communication latency between two meters seeking to acquire synchronized energy readings can be performed by exchanging synchronization packets prior to the measurement start request. It is identified that not the communication latency but the associated jitter is the most important for the accurate synchronization of the distributed energy measurement.},

systems that demand a high degree of reliability and real-time
performance in communications. However, because of limited network
resources and delays caused by transmission conflicts and channel
contention, many industrial applications cannot meet these demands. To
resolve these issues, we introduce Narrow Band Internet of Things
(NB-IoT) technology into industrial networks to reduce transmission
delays. Two challenges are addressed in this work: (1) the primary goal
is to guarantee the schedulability of the system, so the controller must
determine when NB-IoT nodes transmit to base stations; and (2) because
communication through the base station is a paid service, the controller
must minimize the use of NB-IoT slots. We resolve these issues via a
scheduling analysis and transmission mode selection. In addition, we
propose a Path Selection Algorithm (PSA) to improve the schedulability
of the industrial system. Experiments indicate the effectiveness and
efficacy of our approach.},

abstract = {The rapid growth of Internet-of-Things (IoT) in the current decade has led to the the development of a multitude of new access technologies targeted at low-power, wide area networks (LP-WANs). However, this has also created another challenge pertaining to technology selection. This paper reviews the performance of LP-WAN technologies for IoT, including design choices and their implications. We consider Sigfox, LoRaWAN, WavIoT, random phase multiple access (RPMA), narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) as well as LTE-M and assess their performance in terms of signal propagation, coverage and energy conservation. The comparative analyses presented in this paper are based on available data sheets and simulation results. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to evaluate network performance in response to variations in system design parameters. Results show that each of RPMA, NB-IoT and LTE-M incurs at least 9 dB additional path loss relative to Sigfox and LoRaWAN. This study further reveals that with a 10{\%} improvement in receiver sensitivity, NB-IoT 882 MHz and LoRaWAN can increase coverage by up to 398{\%} and 142{\%} respectively, without adverse effects on the energy requirements. Finally, extreme weather conditions can significantly reduce the active network life of LP-WANs. In particular, the results indicate that operating an IoT device in a temperature of -20∘C can shorten its life by about half; 53{\%} (WavIoT, LoRaWAN, Sigfox, NB-IoT, RPMA) and 48{\%} in LTE-M compared with environmental temperature of 40∘C.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) evolving from the conventional wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with more smart sensors has attracted significant attention. As one of the most crucial metrics for evaluating the quality of service (QoS) of both IoT and WSNs, sensing coverage characterizes the monitoring status of a sensing field of interest. However, the existence of coverage holes will remarkably degrade the QoS of the IoT. Based on the novel confident information coverage (CIC) model, this paper provides an in-depth study on how to energy-efficiently heal the multimodal CIC holes (MCICH) in a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT)-enabled hybrid IoT deployed for radiological pollution monitoring, where both mobile and stationary sensors equip multimodal sensing units for sensing dissimilar multimodal physical attributes and the NB-IoT provides satisfied network connectivity. We pinpoint the MCICH healing (MCICHH) problem with the objective of energy-efficiently dispatching a series of multimodal mobile IoT sensors to the CIC holes such that the MCIC holes can be headed and the CIC performance can be satisfied. After proving the NP-completeness of MCICHH by reducing it to the set partition problem, we develop a family of effective heuristic schemes including the centralized-MCICHH, the distributed-MCICHH and random CIC hole healing, all of which target for efficiently healing the MCIC holes while minimizing the total moving energy consumption of the dispatched multimodal mobile sensors or maximizing the average remaining energy of the multimodal mobile sensors. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed schemes.},

In this paper, we empirically explore the boundaries of this technology, analyzing from a user's point of view critical characteristics such as energy consumption, reliability and delays. The results show that its performance in terms of energy is comparable and even outperforms, in some cases, an LPWAN reference technology like LoRa, with the added benefit of guaranteeing delivery.

abstract = {The low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies, which is now embracing a booming era with the development in the Internet of Things (IoT), may offer a brand new solution for current smart grid communications due to their excellent features of low power, long range, and high capacity. The mission-critical smart grid communications require secure and reliable connections between the utilities and the devices with high quality of service (QoS). This is difficult to achieve for unlicensed LPWAN technologies due to the crowded license free band. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT), as a licensed LPWAN technology, is developed based on the existing long-term evolution specifications and facilities. Thus, it is able to provide cellular-level QoS, and henceforth can be viewed as a promising candidate for smart grid communications. In this paper, we introduce NB-IoT to the smart grid and compare it with the existing representative communication technologies in the context of smart grid communications in terms of data rate, latency, range, etc. The overall requirements of communications in the smart grid from both quantitative and qualitative perspectives are comprehensively investigated and each of them is carefully examined for NB-IoT. We further explore the representative applications in the smart grid and analyze the corresponding feasibility of NB-IoT. Moreover, the performance of NB-IoT in typical scenarios of the smart grid communication environments, such as urban and rural areas, is carefully evaluated via Monte Carlo simulations.},

abstract = {Due to the advantages including low cost, low power, massive connections, and wide coverage, and with the assistance of fog computing to achieve low latency, location awareness, etc., Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) can be widely applied in industry. Many NB-IoT industrial applications need a positioning feature for tracking, fault localization and fast repair, etc. When dedicated positioning systems, e.g., Global Position System, are unavailable for a low-power, low-cost NBIoT device, it is necessary to rely on terrestrial cellular network for localization. Existing performance studies in NB-IoT cellular network-based positioning have been mostly carried out by targeting deterministic scenarios. However, it is hard to provide general insights with changing system design parameters and propagation effects, due to the random variations in device location, network coverage, channel condition, etc. This paper develops a general analytical model to study the NB-IoT positioning performance. The location randomness of the device to be localized is considered through the distance distributions between the device and its surrounding Evolved Node Bs (eNBs). This makes it possible for using the powerful probabilistic distancebased tools from geometric probability to derive the probability that at least a fixed number of participating eNBs can be heard by the device. The model considers both the interference and the NB-IoT system-related parameter settings. It also includes modeling the eNB transmission coordination and traffic load. The obtained results reveal how participating eNBs impact the NB-IoT positioning performance, with the effects of a set of parameter settings investigated.},

Industries are utilizing wide-area commercial Long-Term Evolution (LTE) networks to serve immediate and urgent IoT applications today. LTE was designed, however, for broadband service, while IoT is traditionally dominated by low-rate, low-power, and infrequent short-burst data. It is crucial to differentiate the IoT applications from broadband data services to ensure adequate coverage, efficiency, and reliability. In this paper, we present the first field trial performance results of IoT applications using LTE Category 1 devices. The field results show that the sector throughput impact on existing broadband service is less than 2{\%} with 8 simultaneous IoT devices intensively transmitting 250 bytes. The low-cost single radio receiver device could reduce the coverage by 2-5 dB based on field measurements. Increasing control channel power and the number of HARQ retransmissions can compensate for the coverage loss. Signaling overhead and capacity were also studied by incorporating field measurement and network statistics into our system simulator to identify the critical limiting factors. We investigated the positive feedback effect of excessive signaling bearer traffic to ensure network stability. Various new access technologies, such as eMTC, NB-IoT, and 5G, are under development to further improve network performance and efficiency to serve varieties of IoT applications.},

abstract = {We consider channel estimation (CE) in narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) systems. Due to the fluctuations in phase within receiver and transmitter oscillators, and also the residual frequency offset (FO) caused by discontinuous receiving of repetition coded transmit data-blocks, random phase noises are presented in received signals. Although the coherent-time of fading channel can be assumed fairly long due to the low-mobility of NB-IoT user-equipments (UEs), such phase noises have to be considered before combining the the channel estimates over repetition copies to improve their accuracies. In this paper, we derive a sequential minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE) channel estimator in the presence of random phase noise that refines the CE sequentially with each received repetition copy, which has a low-complexity and a small data storage. Further, we show through simulations that, the proposed sequential MMSE estimator improves the mean-square-error (MSE) of CE by 1 dB in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, compared to a traditional sequential MMSE estimator that does not thoroughly consider the impact of random phase noises.},

When multiple uplink users attempt to attach simultaneously, the base station receives superimposed NPRACH preambles and must detect all users and acquire their synchronization parameters: time-of-arrival (ToA) and residual carrier frequency offset (RCFO). In this paper, we first solve the detection problem and derive the optimal Neyman-Pearson detection threshold. Then, we analyze the theoretical detection performance and find the maximum coupling loss (MCL) under both additive white Gaussian noise and Rayleigh fading channels. Next, the FFT phase trace of each detected user is exploited to estimate the user's ToA and RCFO parameters. Simulations reveal that the algorithm has both favorable detection and estimation performances with very low complexity.},

abstract = {This paper provides an updated analysis of link-budget and coverage performance for LTE IoT technologies: enhancements for machine type communications (eMTC) and narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT). Previous studies have used the 3GPP evaluations assumptions and have demonstrated the coverage capabilities of these technologies when they are independently deployed. Some operators are, however, likely to deploy dual-mode networks - eMTC and NB-IoT - with the intent of supporting different applications in the two systems. With all conditions being equal for the two systems in such a scenario, comparison of the eMTC and NB-IoT technologies then requires that all assumptions are aligned. This paper extends the previous studies with the assumptions aligned for eMTC and NB-IoT systems to provide a fair coverage performance comparison. The study shows that compared to the 3GPP assumption, under the aligned assumptions, both eMTC and NB-IoT can support up to 5dB and 3dB higher uplink coverage, respectively. We further show these link budget improvements yield significantly reduced LTE IoT coverage outage in two simulated scenarios based on real network deployments: a wide area rural case and an urban deep indoor case. The results further demonstrate the potential of these LTE IoT technologies in realistic network deployment conditions.},

Comparing with the legacy human-centric applications, machine type communication (MTC) scenarios exhibit totally different characteristics such as low throughput, delay insensitivity, occasional transmission and deep coverage. Meanwhile, it also requires the terminal devices to be cheap enough and sustain long battery life. These demands hasten the prosperity of low power wide area (LPWA) technologies. Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) is the newest Long Term Evolution (LTE) specification ratified by the Third Generation Partner Project (3GPP) as one of the LPWA solutions to achieve the objectives of super coverage, low power, low cost and massive connection. Working in the licensed frequency band, it is designed to reuse and coexist with the existing LTE cellular networks, which endows it with outstanding advantages in decreasing network installation cost and minimizing product time-to-market. In this backdrop, it has been extensively regarded as one of the most promising technologies towards the IoT landscape. However, as a new LTE standard, there are still a lot of challenges that need to overcome. This article surveys its evolutions, technologies and issues, spanning from performance analysis, design optimization, combination with other leading technologies, to implementation and application. The goal is to deliver a holistic understanding for the emerging wireless communication system, in helping to spur further research in accelerating the broad use of NB-IoT.},

In conventional long term evolution (LTE) system, a ZC-based primary synchronisation signal (PSS) waveform is used to deal with the timing issue due to its `perfect' autocorrelation property. However, in the Internet of things (IoT) scenarios, the initial frequency offset caused by the inaccurate crystal oscillator can be very large due to the low-cost requirement. ZC sequence is sensitive to the frequency offset especially the very large frequency offset. A new PSS waveform with frequency offset tolerance is proposed to improve the timing performance by using a couple of chirp signals.

abstract = {Narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) is one of the emerging 5G technologies, but might introduce narrowband interference (NBI) to existing broadband systems, such as long-term evolution advanced (LTE-A) systems. Thus, the mitigation of the NB-IoT interference to LTE-A is an important issue for the harmonic coexistence and compatibility between 4G and 5G. In this paper, a newly emerged sparse approximation technique, block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL), is utilized to estimate the NB-IoT interference in LTE-A systems. The block sparse representation of the NBI is constituted through the proposed temporal differential measuring approach, and the BSBL theory is utilized to recover the practical block sparse NBI. A BSBL-based method, partition estimated BSBL, is proposed. With the aid of the estimated block partition beforehand, the Bayesian parameters are obtained to yield the NBI estimation. The intra-block correlation (IBC) is considered to facilitate the recovery. Moreover, exploiting the inherent structure of the identical IBC matrix, another method of informative BSBL is proposed to further improve the accuracy, which does not require prior estimation of the block partition. Reported simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods are effective in canceling the NB-IoT interference in LTE-A systems, and significantly outperform other conventional methods.},

abstract = {The emerging fog computing and Narrow-band Internet of Thing (NB-IoT) wireless technologies are indispensable for the next-generation massive machine type communication (mMTC) applications. However, the communication capacity of NB-IoT is limited compared to the ever-growing number of NB-IoT devices. Further, the optimal assignment of different computational jobs ignites the issue of load balancing in the fog network to ensure a well-balanced computational resource allocation. Therefore, in this paper we formulate a fog load balancing problem considering communication and computation constraints, where the objective is to minimize the load balancing cost of the fog computing network empowered with the NB-IoT. First, we model the time resource scheduling problem in NB-IoT as a Bankruptcy game. Within the game framework, we enforce the Shapley value-based strategic policy for the NB-IoT devices to perform uplink scheduling for mMTC applications while calculating the transmission costs of the computational jobs.We also propose greedy iterative time scheduling (GITS), complementary to the Shapley value-based scheduling but with less computational complexity. Second, we decompose the fog load balancing problem into a Hitchcock-Koopmans transportation problem that defines the overutilized and underutilized fog computing nodes based on the computational resource utilization. Subsequently, we solve the transportation problem by applying Vogel's Approximation Method (VAM), which finds a feasible load balancing solution to ensure optimal job assignment in the fog computing network. The simulation results illustrate that the average job load balancing cost with our approach is significantly reduced compared to the baseline methods.},

abstract = {Narrow Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is the specification defined by 3GPP for cellular IoT devices spanning a variety of IoT applications. Typical NB-IoT applications demand very long battery life. Improving battery life without impacting the application's communication needs is of great importance to extend the battery life in many applications. Coverage enhancement feature of NB-IoT requires eNB to choose a repetition from the finite set of values ranging from 1 to 2048. When the channel is favourable, user equipment (UE) may not need all the repetitions for decoding in downlink (DL). In this paper, we propose, an opportunistic early decode algorithm for downlink, using received bit information rate (RBIR) based link abstraction. This helps in reducing the total active time and hence the power consumption of device aiding the longer battery life. Performance gain of this algorithm is evaluated in various channel conditions of a fading environment and further validated the gains with a simplified analytical model of the considered system. Typical power savings observed are in the range of {\~{}}45{\%}.},

abstract = {In this paper, a Machine to Machine (M2M) Relay mechanism is proposed to save energy consumption by reducing the number of repetition in a Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) system, which is a 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) user equipment (UE) category for low-power, low-complexity and battery-powered devices. A NB-IoT system can support the access of a large number of devices ranging over a coverage area larger than the typical cell in a cellular mobile network by adopting the repetition-based transmission to increase the receiver processing gain, i.e., to increase the chance of successful data transmission. 3GPP NB-IoT RAN1 already defines that the number of repetition will binary exponentially increase when the receiving signal strength decreases. This may induce surplus repetition, i.e., unnecessary energy consumption. Moreover, for devices in the edge of a cell, the inferior radio condition will incur abundant repetitions, depleting the battery energy very quickly. Thus, by using the Machine to Machine (M2M) Relay that is already developed and defined in 3GPP standard, a novel mechanism for adequate relay UE selecting and optimal relay scheduling is proposed to effectively reduce the energy consumption but maintain the system throughput and UE QoS. The extensive simulations is executed in a setting of 1000 devices distributed according to a Poisson Point Process over a cell of the radios of 125 transmission distance units. If a UE located within a transmission distance unit to the eNB; it needs only one repetition to successfully transmit data. Simulation results show that the repetition number will drop dramatically in all simulation cases. The less number of transmitting devices, the higher saving ration of repetition. For transmitting device density 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, the repetition saving ratio is 0.7, 0.69, and 0.65 respectively. This indicating that by the proposed M2M relay scheduling mechanism, when the transmitting device density is 0.3, the system can save a huge 65{\%} energy consumption.},

@article{Chakrapani2017,
abstract = {Next generation cellular networks (5G) have to deal with deployment of
massive machine-type-communication (MTC) devices as the internet of
things (IoT) becomes pervasive. To cater to such demand, 3GPP has
finalized specifications for enhanced machine type communication (eMTC)
and narrowband IoT (NBIoT) as part of LTE Release 13(1). To avoid
resource congestion to legacy users, eMTC communication can be limited
to predefined eMTC narrowband(s) with receiver bandwidth of 1.08MHz,
whereas in NB-IoT all communications are limited to a single resource
block(2). Both eMTC and NB-IoT are designed to cater for bandwidth
limited low complexity/coverage enhancement (BL/CE) devices, with MTC
messages repeated across several BL/CE subframes lasting up to several
seconds, to accomodate for large maximum coupling losses (MCL). To avoid
MTC users from hogging, collide with legacy resources during lengthy
repetitions, 3GPP defines BL/CE subframes and has made provisions for
valid and invalid BL/CE subframes to be configured. With large number of
MTC devices sharing limited resources and message repetitions lasting
several SFs, the LTE medium access control (MAC) scheduler processing
burden will be significantly increased. This is because the scheduler
operates on a subframe (SF) basis and has to find the MTC users who can
be scheduled either in the current SF, or at a future SF after ongoing
repetitions finish, or within a gap between previously scheduled
repetitions. Another complexity is that the control messages(e.g.,
MPDCCH) can only be scheduled at certain start intervals and within
predefined boundaries. In this paper we address these problems with a
low complexity constant time scheduling scheme for MTC users(3) when
invalid BL/CE SFs are configured. The proposed algorithms are generic
and applicable to both eNB and UE implementation. With detailed system
level simulations we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed scheme
when large number of MTC users are active in the system.},

On average, tendrils contain six galaxies and span 10 h-1 Mpc. We use the so-called line correlation function to prove that tendrils represent real structures rather than accidental alignments. We show that voids found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, 7th data release survey that overlap with GAMA regions contain a large number of galaxies, primarily belonging to tendrils. This implies that void sizes are strongly dependent on the number density and sensitivity limits of a survey. We caution that galaxies in low-density regions, which may be defined as `void galaxies,' will have local galaxy number densities that depend on such observational limits and are likely higher than those can be directly measured.

In this paper, we consider the scenario that NB-IoT is deployed in an heterogeneous network and the quality of the direct link from the NB-IoT user equipment (TIE) to the serving base station (BS) cannot satisfy the quality of service requirement for transmission of vital sensing data. Thereupon, device-to-device (D2D) communication is adopted as a routing extension to NB-IoT systems, and thus, enables two-hop routes between NB-IoT TIE and the serving BS via a set of D2D relays. As the candidate TIE relays work in duty cycle to save energy, we derive a model to select a set of TIE relays and perform opportunistic D2D communication according to a working schedule. Two optimization problems are formulated aiming at achieving optimal expected delivery ratio (EDR) and expected two-hop delay, respectively. Dynamic programming-based algorithms are proposed to solve the optimization problems and obtain the optimal working schedule of the relays. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed maxEDR and minEED algorithms improves the system performance compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {In 3GPP, a narrowband system based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) has been introduced to support the Internet of Things. This system, named Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), provides low-cost devices, high coverage (20 dB improvement over LTE/GPRS), long device battery life (more than 10 years), and massive capacity. Latency is relaxed although a delay budget of 10 seconds is the target for exception reports. NB-IoT can be deployed in three different operation modes - (1) stand-alone as a dedicated carrier, (2) in-band within the occupied bandwidth of a wideband LTE carrier, and (3) within the guard-band of an existing LTE carrier. In this paper, we undertake a deployment study of NB-IoT using existing LTE infrastructure. We consider the case when only a fraction of the existing LTE cell sites support NB-IoT (so called partial deployment of NB-IoT). In this case, NB-IoT devices cannot attach to the best cell if that cell does not support NB-IoT. As a result, the path loss can be very high. In addition, they also suffer from high interference from non-NB-IoT cells. We examine potential techniques to compensate for the high path-loss and high interference and provide analysis to indicate when partial deployment of NB-IoT is feasible. We also examine interference issues in asynchronous deployments and study performance.},

Meanwhile, edge computing servers interact with corresponding management personnel through mobile devices based on the collected information.

abstract = {As cellular networks are evolving toward the fifth generation/long-term evolution systems, cellular radio access networks are expected to provide high throughput and reliable connectivity for massive number of smart devices (SDs), which leads to the emerging narrowband Internet of Things (NBIoT), a cellular-assisted low-power wide area IoT system. Driven by the potential critical missions, such as transportation safety and video surveillance that require high throughput and lowpower consumption, we investigate the small-cell assisted traffic offloading for NB-IoT systems. Taking into account the offloading through small cells operating on unlicensed bands, we account for the secrecy-outage issue in which some malicious eavesdroppers might intentionally overhead the offloaded data delivered to small cells. We first formulate a joint traffic scheduling and power allocation problem to minimize the total power consumption of SDs, while satisfying both the traffic throughput requirement and secrecy-requirement. Despite the nonconvexity of the problem, we propose an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal offloading solution. With the per-SD's optimal offloading solution, we further investigate a multi-SDs multi access-points (APs) scenario, in which different SDs select different APs for providing offloading service to minimize the overall offloading-cost for all SDs. Specifically, we formulate an optimal SD-AP pairing problem to find the optimal pairing between the SDs and APs. Numerical results have been provided to validate our proposed algorithm and show the performance gain of our proposed traffic offloading for the NB-IoT systems.},

On the one hand, this diversity offers operators sufficient flexibility to select the most appropriate RAT for their target application. On the other hand, it becomes a severe limiting factor leading to high level of uncertainty for the IoT device vendors, who need to decide, which technology to support in their hardware. In this paper, we consider the provisioning of the low-power wide area network (LPWAN) devices supporting multiple RATs. First, we briefly discuss the parameters of several potential radio technologies as well as analyze the pros and cons of combining them in a single device. Next, we prototype a real-life device capable of communicating via two perspective LPWAN technologies, namely, LoRaWAN and NB-IoT, and report on the initial results of its performance evaluation. These confirm the feasibility of instrumenting dual-mode devices as well as reveal several important aspects related to the development of multi-radio IoT equipment and its performance. In our view, due to their higher flexibility, reliability, and dependability, the devices such as the one developed can be beneficial for various Smart City applications, with smart energy grids and road traffic control being only two of many examples.},

These types of devices will be inexpensive (less than {\$}5) and deployed on massive scales. This long life expectancy will lead to the need for occasional software updates, to very large groups of devices. While a new multicast mechanism has recently been proposed for the efficient multicast transmission of such updates, it assumes that devices can be grouped together and synchronized in order to receive the multicast data. In this paper, we explore three different approaches to achieve device grouping, with different trade-offs between bandwidth usage, energy consumption and compliance with the NB-IoT standard. To assess the performance of each pproach, we conducted a thorough experimental evaluation under realistic operating conditions.},

abstract = {Machine-type communication (MTC) is the key technology to support data transfer among devices (sensors and actuators) in Internet of Things (IoT). Although cellular communication technologies are developed mainly for “human-type” communications, enabling MTC with cellular networks not only improves the connectivity, accessibility, and availability of an MTC network but also has the potential to further drive down the operation cost. However, cellular MTC, especially when applied to low-power massive IoT (mIoT), poses some unique challenges due to the low-cost and low-power nature of an mIoT device. One of the most challenging issues is providing a robust way for an mIoT device to acquire the network under a large frequency offset due to the use of low-cost crystal oscillators and under extended coverage. Although differentiation is a well-known technique for removing impairments caused by frequency offset, its “noise amplification” effect limits its applications in cellular communications due to the fact that cellular communication is typically interference limited. Matched-filter-based detection is, therefore, almost unexceptionally used. We show that the differential technique can actually benefit system acquisition in mIoT, where the use of low-cost crystals is a default. Although the existing system acquisition design in a cellular mIoT system, i.e., NB-IoT, facilitates both techniques, there still remain issues that need to be solved in order to take full advantage of the design. We provide a comprehensive analysis on the performance of two most common techniques when applied in a typical NB-IoT environment based on two factors, the geometry factor and the frequency offset factor. Finally, we derive the operating regions for matched-filter-based detection and differentiation using these two factors, in which the system acquisition performance of the two types of techniques is maximized- for NB-IoT.},

Effective design methodologies and techniques, from the system level to circuit level, are proposed to address various design challenges while achieving low-power consumption. The TRX consists of a low-IF receiver with 180-kHz signal bandwidth, a digital polar transmitter with 3.75-kHz signal bandwidth, and a fractional-N frequency synthesizer. Passive current mixer is employed in the receiver to improve the linearity and avoid the sensitivity degradation due to 1/f noise. Automatic I/Q imbalance calibration is integrated to improve image rejection ratio (IRR) with the aid of external FPGA. The transmitter is implemented in the digital polar architecture to improve the narrow-band spectrum purity, integrated with an inverse Class-D digital power amplifier (DPA) to achieve high output power and efficiency. A Class-C voltage-controlled oscillator with automatic frequency control assisted the dynamic gate biasing technique is used in the fractional-N PLL frequency synthesizer. Two prototypes are implemented in 180-nm CMOS. By optimizing analog baseband configuration in the receiver and utilizing the revised thermometer-coding and binary-coding-based array placement in the DPA, the receiver achieves 4.0-dB noise figure, 48-dB IRR, and 60-dB PGA dynamic range, and the DPA outputs 23.2dBm maximum saturation power with 44.5{\%} PAE. Furthermore, the transmitter system verifications demonstrate 3.87{\%} error-vector magnitude (EVM) for 891 MHz $\pi$/4-DQPSK signals at 18.87-dBm output power with -40-dBc out-of-band rejection. The transmitter achieves a dynamic range from -35 to 20 dBm when the demodulation EVM threshold of the system is set to 10{\%}.},

abstract = {In this paper we present four Radio Frequency (RF) measurements used to evaluate fundamental performance parameters of Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) equipment. We describe the relevant theory for each measurement, and then we proceed to explain the algorithms associated with it. These algorithms are implemented using LabVIEW in a GSM Measurement Toolkit (GMT). GMT is developed for National Instruments (NI) to be used with the PXI-5660 RF Signal Analyzer (RFSA) to test RF equipment. Using this toolkit, a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) downlink signal and a Mobile Station (MS) uplink signal are tested to ensure their conformance to 3 rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) standards.},
