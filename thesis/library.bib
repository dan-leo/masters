abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) is a way of connecting everything around us together, which would be widely applied in the 5G era. Narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) is one of the solutions introduced from 3{\textless}sup{\textgreater}rd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} Generation Partner Project (3GPP) Release-13 to fulfill this concept. Massive-connection and narrow band operation are two key features of NB-IoT. With current NB-IoT design, certain resources within narrow band are dedicated for transmitting paging information of massive connections. This leads to overload of the dedicated resources, and consequently increased padding bits and low resource efficiency. Moreover, UE power consumption would also rise due to the extra effort to decode larger packets. To solve above problems, a new resource allocation method is proposed, which includes a new definition of paging resource set and corresponding resource selection method. Link level simulation is conducted to show the benefit of our proposals. It is observed that approximately power consumption could be saved by 80{\%} and the resource efficiency could be improved by 30.5{\%} by utilizing our proposed methods.},

abstract = {In 3GPP, a narrowband system based on Long Term Evolution (LTE) is being introduced to support the Internet of Things. This system, named Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), can be deployed in three different operation modes - (1) stand-alone as a dedicated carrier, (2) in-band within the occupied bandwidth of a wideband LTE carrier, and (3) within the guard-band of an existing LTE carrier. In stand-alone operation mode, NB-IoT can occupy one GSM channel (200 kHz) while for in-band and guard-band operation modes, it will use one physical resource block of LTE (180 kHz). The design targets of NB-IoT include low-cost devices, high coverage (20-dB improvement over GPRS), long device battery life (more than 10 years), and massive capacity. Latency is relaxed although a delay budget of 10 seconds is the target for exception reports. The specifications for NB-IoT are expected to be finalized in 2016. In this paper, we describe the targets for NB-IoT and present a preliminary system design. In addition, coverage, capacity, latency, and battery life analysis are also presented.},

abstract = {Narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) is a newly developed 3GPP protocol optimized for low-power wide-area IoT applications and is evolving toward the future fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication. It specifies at least 23dBm maximum output power for long-range communication, stringent emission mask compatible with guard-band or in-band scenarios, and it supports multiple operation bands from 699 to 915MHz (LB) and from 1710 to 1980MHz (HB). For cost reduction, longer battery life, and fast time to market, the integration of high-power high-efficiency power amplifiers (PAs) on-chip is greatly demanded. To benefit from advanced CMOS technology, the digital polar transmitter has become a very attractive architecture for NB-IoT applications [1]. To simultaneously support dual bands for user flexibility, the traditional solution is to implement two separately optimized PAs [2], which requires extra design effort and increases die area. An ultra-compact single-transformer-based parallel power combiner proposed in [3] provides optimum load transformation in the two operation bands. Moreover, to support higher throughputs and achieve better spectral efficiency, high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) multi-subcarrier modulation is adopted in NB-IoT, which requires the PA to be efficient not only at peak power but also at power back-off (PBO) to extend battery life. Efficiency boosting techniques of digital Doherty PAs have been shown in [4-6], but two transformers are needed in the passive network. In this work, a high-power digital Doherty PA for NB-IoT applications is proposed and introduces a parallel-combining-transformer (PCT) power combiner for dual-band coverage, back-off efficiency enhancement, and ultra-compact implementation.},

abstract = {Most senior citizens are often neglected and are helpless in times of medical emergencies, as they are alone in their twilight years. To tackle this, we have come up with a prospective Remote Health Monitoring and Alert System (RHMAS). In elderly people heart attacks are associated with symptoms like, body temperature fluctuations, high BP, profuse sweating, improper cardiac rhythm etc. Our solution is to integrate robust sensors capable of sensing and monitoring these symptoms with a microcontroller to alert the next of kin and health services during emergencies. Since most devices for this purpose are wired, a wireless device wouldn't interfere with the movement of the user The proposed system consists of a Photo-Plethysmography (PPG) based pulse sensor, to detect arrhythmia, a temperature sensor to constantly monitor their body temperature and a sweat sensor to monitor the Galvanic Skin Response (GSR). A GSM module will send an alert to the next of kin if the monitored data deviates from the nominal body condition. If the monitored data reaches emergency levels, health services would also be alerted.},

abstract = {In today's society fall has become a very serious issue and also a threat to older generation. Fall leads to major injuries, physical disability and sometimes death. Therefore, there is a need to design a dependable embedded system device which will help in detecting the fall and further sends an emergency notification and thus helps in preventing the fall. Many researchers have considered human fall as an unpredictable danger to the life of older generation. Hence lot of research has been done in this area to develop a fall detection system. The existing fall detection systems are efficient but they lack in sensor optimization, early fall detection and efficient wireless communication. In this study, we have demonstrated a pre-fall detection system which detects human falls approximately 250 ms before it occurs. Early fall detection helps in preventing the subject from serious injuries. The designed system monitors user balanced and unbalanced state. Once the unbalance state is detected the system signifies it as a fall, thus gives milliseconds of time to trigger the safety devices like wearable airbag worn by a subject. On fall the system sends emergency notification to the care taker using either Internet of things (IoT) or Bluetooth low energy (BLE). The Hardware system is designed such that it consumes low power and it is a dependable embedded system with easy to wear capabilities for the subject. The designed system uses Arm Processor associated with motion sensors, communication sensors, Signal sensor and MicroSD Card. The software and hardware combination was developed to get optimal low power consumption by switching the CPU between active and sleep mode. The practical experiments performed on the designed system results in giving the 100{\%} sensitivity and 98.07{\%} specificity for fall detection. The wireless communication is efficiently designed such that the power is consumed only when the fall is triggered. The designed system acknowledges the difference - etween activity of daily living (ADL) like walking, sitting running, and climbing stairs with actual fall.},

abstract = {OAPA Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is the prominent technology that fits the requirements of future Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, due to the limited spectrum (i.e., 180 kHz) availability for NB-IoT systems, one of the key issues is how to efficiently use these resources to support massive IoT devices? Furthermore, in NB-IoT, to reduce the computation complexity and to provide coverage extension, the concept of time offset and repetition has been introduced. Considering these new features, the existing resource management schemes are no longer applicable. Moreover, the allocation of frequency band for NB-IoT within LTE band, or as a standalone, might not be synchronous in all the cells, resulting in intercell interference (ICI) from the neighbouring cells {\&} {\#}x2019; LTE users or NB-IoT users (synchronous case). In this paper, first a theoretical framework for the upper bound on the achievable data rate is formulated in the presence of control channel and repetition factor. From the conducted analysis, it is shown that the maximum achievable data rates are 89.2 Kbps and 92 Kbps for downlink and uplink, respectively. Secondly, we propose an interference aware resource allocation for NB-IoT by formulating the rate maximization problem considering the overhead of control channels, time offset and repetition factor. Due to the complexity of finding the globally optimum solution of the formulated problem, a sub-optimal solution with an iterative algorithm based on cooperative approaches is proposed. The proposed algorithm is then evaluated to investigate the impact of repetition factor, time offset and ICI on the NB-IoT data rate and energy consumption. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the non-cooperative, cooperative, and optimal scheme (i.e., no repetition) is also presented. It is shown through the simulation results that the cooperative scheme provides up to 8 {\&} {\#}x0025; rate improvement and 17 {\&} {\#}x0025; energy reduction as compared to the non-cooperative scheme.},

By employing the technology it is easier to treat patients quickly in emergency situations where the life can be saved if adequate medical assistance is provided in time. Based on the concept of telemedicine we have designed and developed a portable telemedicine system which is very compact, user friendly and economical. The portable telemedicine is very useful in the event of life threatening situations like heart attack (Strokes), instant high body temperatures, or abnormal BP conditions etc. Now-a-days there are several telemedicine systems available in the market. However, only a few are useful in the emergency situations. These systems are expensive and bulky and out of reach for most of the common people. The purpose of this paper is to come up with a new idea where these lifesaving telemedicine devices should become affordable for common people by making use of the latest prevailing technologies. In this paper we are going to introduce `Portable Emergency System' which is based on FTC - Find-Treat-Care technique. This system is designed with the integration of various technologies such as GSM/GPRS, GPS, sensors (wearable device) and P2P. The proposed new system will be useful for common people, during the emergency situations to diagnose the mobile heart (Cardiac) patients, diabetic patients, elderly people as well as an accident victim. The prime objective of the proposed new system is to provide urgent provisional medication and shifting of patient to the nearby hospital in time which can save the life of many people before the first contact with an expert doctor.},

The target is to evaluate which of the four technologies provides the best coverage for Internet of Things devices, which may be located deep indoor. The results show that Narrowband-IoT, having the best Maximum Coupling Loss performance of 164 dB, also provides the best coverage. This is despite the fact that LoRa and SigFox deployments with omnidirectional antennas are found to provide 3 dB lower link loss on average. In the deployment 11 {\%} of the geographical area contains devices, located both in rural and urban areas. The NB-IoT has an outage below 1 {\%} for locations experiencing 20 dB indoor penetration loss in addition to the outdoor path loss. SigFox performs similarly, while LoRa cannot provide coverage for 2 {\%} of those locations. For the challenging deep indoor case, where 30 dB additional penetration loss is expected, NB-IoT has 8 {\%} outage while SigFox and LoRa is unable to cover 13 {\%} and 20 {\%} of the locations. The four technologies may not be deployed at all existing site locations and therefore the work also includes a study of the coverage as a function of the minimum Inter-Site Distance, where sites closer than 2, 4, and 6 km are filtered out. The results show that SigFox and NB-IoT have outage probabilities below 5 {\%} even though sites closer than 4 km are removed from the simulations.},

abstract = {Wearable healthcare system has been interesting topic among all the fields like Biomedical, electronics, IT field etc. Hence there are numerous application in this field where as patient's can see their own physiological measurements and doctors as well. Wearable monitoring system is advantageous to the patients and community where it reduces billing amount, waiting time also reduces the rush in the hospital. The aim of this paper is to maintain the patient's physiological parameters and activity in the hospital. There is alert system notification for emergency cases. Doctors can see the graphical view of patient's parameter. The system consists of computer, Wi-Fi network and display which are worn by patients. The abnormal conditions of patients' data are sent to the doctors twitter account, and/or the relative via twitter messaging, to alert them about the situation. The system is very helpful in big hospitals where the count numbers of patients are more than number of hospital staff or attendants.},

The latter is intended to provide a earth to satellite SOS communication in case of shipwrecks or similar crashes and it is currently implemented in emergency devices like buoys. In the proposed work, two dipoles have been attached on different floating elements of a life jacket, in order to form a wearable emergency system that could be worn by any survivor. The two antennas are folded meandered dipoles operating at 406 MHz, center frequency of the Cospas sarsat system. A metallic sheet is used to shield the antennas from the human body and it is placed on the opposite side of the floating element with respect to each antenna. Antennas are linearly polarized with good impedance matching also when they are worn by the user, a wide radiation pattern beam and a high gain. Moreover they are orthogonal in order to form a diversity pattern transmitting system. Prototypes have been realized and a measurement campaign has been carried out showing good performance.},

abstract = {The emerging pervasive computing is regarded as a promising solution to the systems of personal healthcare and emergency aid, which can monitor personal health status in a real-time manner and automatically issue the alert for medical aids in case of emergency. However, the implementation of such a system is not trivial due to the issues, including (1) the system operations without complicated caregiver aid to reduce cost of human resource, (2) vital sensor deployment for user comfort, (3) on-site vital data process and storage for energy saving in data transmission, and (4) timely communication with healthcare centre for reporting users' health status and seeking urgent medical aids. In this paper, we propose a novel wearable personal healthcare and emergency aid system, namely WAITER. Our system does not require specific caregiver aid. WAITER just employs the tiny wearable sensors to continuously collect user's vital signals and Bluetooth device to transmit the sensory data to a mobile phone, which can perform on-site vital data storage and process. After local data process, the mobile phone can use its GSM module to periodically report users' health status to the healthcare centre and issue alert for medical aids once detecting emergency. We believe that WAITER can satisfy the requirements of real personal healthcare and emergency aid system.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-to-end LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University.},

A Smart Health Monitoring System, such as the one designed in this study, aims to automate patient monitoring tasks. In the present study we have designed and developed a GSM (Global System for Mobile) based smart wearable system with 3-axis Accelerometer, 3-lead ECG recording system and real-time NIBP analysis system. The device is capable of detecting sudden fall situations, cardiac abnormalities {\&} hyper/hypotension; thereby rendering it suitable for real-time monitoring, self-diagnosis and remote diagnosis purposes. The system is also capable of sending notifications to healthcare professionals immediately after the detection of any of the aforementioned health abnormalities so that the necessary steps are taken. The complete analysis and evaluation of the signals acquired from the patient have been performed using a software platform: NI LabVIEW. It is a cost-effective, smart and wearable health monitoring system that is of immense importance not only to the elderly and post-operative patients, but also to those residing in remote locations and are incapable of affording expensive healthcare in urban hospitals or clinics.},

Most panic button type emergency call devices also require actively pressing a button to contact emergency services. The requirement of active intervention by the victim (through dialing 911 or pressing a button) reduces the effectiveness of the service for ensuring personal safety. To resolve this problem, we use the notion of a smart wearable device, in the form of a smart jewelry bracelet, to automatically sense, detect, and identify physical assault. The smart bracelet uses a multitude of sensors and machine learning to detect an assault as it takes place and then proceeds to contact emergency services and take a series of protective actions. In this demo, we will demonstrate the smart jewelry bracelet and show its usability and effectiveness in providing a low-cost, practical, and usable tool for preventing physical assault and attacks, as well as helping elderly users.},

abstract = {—The next generation of mobile systems must provide a balancing strategy towards M2M (Machine-to-Machine) traffic, while maintaining a sustainable Quality of Service (QoS) for H2H (Human-to-Human) traffic, especially with the expected exponential growth of the number of M2M devices in the coming years carried by the advance of the IoT (Internet of Things) technology. In normal situations, it is obvious that using a 1.4 MHz bandwidth in Long Term Evolution for Machines (LTE-M), helps in improving M2M device complexity, cost and battery life effectively. However, in emergency scenarios, an expected M2M storm will lead inevitably to a fast resource depletion accompanied by an eNodeB congestion in a split second. In this manuscript, we propose a novel scheme "LTE-M Adaptive eNodeB", which gradually solves the eNodeB overload problem, while keeping the H2H traffic QoS not to be affected badly. Moreover, We adaptively manage network resources to allow both traffic to efficiently access the LTE network via SimuLTE open-source modeler. Eventually, an evaluation of the mutual impact of M2M and H2H coexistence is also presented. Keywords— IoT, LTE-A, LTE-M, NB-IoT, LPWAN, M2M, H2H, SimuLTE, eNodeB, Overload Congestion Mechanism.},

The smartwatch has several functionalities; the most important are automatic fall detection, SOS button, communication with carers, location detection in case of emergency, and general activity monitoring. The smartwatch communicates with the server via GSM, therefore it does not depend on wireless internet or Bluetooth connection. The tablet acts as a virtual doorman and also as an interface for the carer, while the portal acts as a central information hub for notifications, scheduling of tasks, and user overview.

abstract = {In this paper, a smart wearable health monitoring technology is presented with the GPS tracking ability for the children with autism. The main problem faced by the parents of an autistic child is to regular monitor the health condition of their children. An autistic child may have several health issues and requires constant monitoring of heart rate, pulse and body temperature but it is quite tough for parents and caretaker to measure health parameters regulary. Another acute problem is to keep tracking of the location of an autistic child whenever he or she is outside of the home without parents or caretakers. Conventional tracking devices have the limitation of small battery life. To overcome these problems, a wearable device is proposed which will be able to measure the temperature and pulse of the child and send notification with detailed information to the parents. The device will be able to detect the coordinates of it's user. Parents will have the ability to set parameters for a specific region of area. The device will send the coordinates of the child with regular notification and emergency alerts will be immediately notified whenever the pulse rate or temperature varies more or less than the standard value and whenever the child will be detected out of predefined coordinates. A wearable solar charging unit is proposed to overcome the limitation of small battery life so that the device will be always charged up whenever the child is traveling or outside of home.},
