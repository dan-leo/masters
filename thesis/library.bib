abstract = {Narrowband Internet-of-Things (NB-IoT) is a newly developed 3GPP protocol optimized for low-power wide-area IoT applications and is evolving toward the future fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication. It specifies at least 23dBm maximum output power for long-range communication, stringent emission mask compatible with guard-band or in-band scenarios, and it supports multiple operation bands from 699 to 915MHz (LB) and from 1710 to 1980MHz (HB). For cost reduction, longer battery life, and fast time to market, the integration of high-power high-efficiency power amplifiers (PAs) on-chip is greatly demanded. To benefit from advanced CMOS technology, the digital polar transmitter has become a very attractive architecture for NB-IoT applications [1]. To simultaneously support dual bands for user flexibility, the traditional solution is to implement two separately optimized PAs [2], which requires extra design effort and increases die area. An ultra-compact single-transformer-based parallel power combiner proposed in [3] provides optimum load transformation in the two operation bands. Moreover, to support higher throughputs and achieve better spectral efficiency, high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) multi-subcarrier modulation is adopted in NB-IoT, which requires the PA to be efficient not only at peak power but also at power back-off (PBO) to extend battery life. Efficiency boosting techniques of digital Doherty PAs have been shown in [4-6], but two transformers are needed in the passive network. In this work, a high-power digital Doherty PA for NB-IoT applications is proposed and introduces a parallel-combining-transformer (PCT) power combiner for dual-band coverage, back-off efficiency enhancement, and ultra-compact implementation.},

abstract = {Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) networks are attracting a lot of attention primarily because of their ability to offer affordable connectivity to the low-power devices distributed over very large geographical areas. In realizing the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT), LPWA technologies complement and sometimes supersede the conventional cellular and short range wireless technologies in performance for various emerging smart city and machine-to-machine (M2M) applications. This survey paper presents the design goals and the techniques, which different LPWA technologies exploit to offer wide-area coverage to low-power devices at the expense of low data rates. We survey several emerging LPWA technologies and the standardization activities carried out by different standards development organizations (e.g., IEEE, IETF, 3GPP, ETSI) as well as the industrial consortia built around individual LPWA technologies (e.g., LORa Alliance,WEIGHTLESS-SIG, and DASH7 Alliance). We further note that LPWA technologies adopt similar approaches, thus sharing the same limitations and challenges. This paper expands on these research challenges and identifies potential directions to address them. While the proprietary LPWA technologies are already hitting the market with large nationwide roll-outs, this paper encourages an active engagement of the research community in solving problems that will shape the connectivity of tens of billions of devices in the next decade.},

abstract = {In this paper, a smart wearable health monitoring technology is presented with the GPS tracking ability for the children with autism. The main problem faced by the parents of an autistic child is to regular monitor the health condition of their children. An autistic child may have several health issues and requires constant monitoring of heart rate, pulse and body temperature but it is quite tough for parents and caretaker to measure health parameters regulary. Another acute problem is to keep tracking of the location of an autistic child whenever he or she is outside of the home without parents or caretakers. Conventional tracking devices have the limitation of small battery life. To overcome these problems, a wearable device is proposed which will be able to measure the temperature and pulse of the child and send notification with detailed information to the parents. The device will be able to detect the coordinates of it's user. Parents will have the ability to set parameters for a specific region of area. The device will send the coordinates of the child with regular notification and emergency alerts will be immediately notified whenever the pulse rate or temperature varies more or less than the standard value and whenever the child will be detected out of predefined coordinates. A wearable solar charging unit is proposed to overcome the limitation of small battery life so that the device will be always charged up whenever the child is traveling or outside of home.},

abstract = {—The next generation of mobile systems must provide a balancing strategy towards M2M (Machine-to-Machine) traffic, while maintaining a sustainable Quality of Service (QoS) for H2H (Human-to-Human) traffic, especially with the expected exponential growth of the number of M2M devices in the coming years carried by the advance of the IoT (Internet of Things) technology. In normal situations, it is obvious that using a 1.4 MHz bandwidth in Long Term Evolution for Machines (LTE-M), helps in improving M2M device complexity, cost and battery life effectively. However, in emergency scenarios, an expected M2M storm will lead inevitably to a fast resource depletion accompanied by an eNodeB congestion in a split second. In this manuscript, we propose a novel scheme "LTE-M Adaptive eNodeB", which gradually solves the eNodeB overload problem, while keeping the H2H traffic QoS not to be affected badly. Moreover, We adaptively manage network resources to allow both traffic to efficiently access the LTE network via SimuLTE open-source modeler. Eventually, an evaluation of the mutual impact of M2M and H2H coexistence is also presented. Keywords— IoT, LTE-A, LTE-M, NB-IoT, LPWAN, M2M, H2H, SimuLTE, eNodeB, Overload Congestion Mechanism.},

The LPWA connectivity is used to serve a diverse range of vertical applications, including agriculture, consumer, industrial, logistic, smart building, smart city and utilities. 3GPP has defined the maiden Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) specification in Release 13 (Rel-13) to accommodate the LPWA demand.

In Telekom Malaysia, we have setup a NB-IoT trial network for End-to-End (E2E) integration study. Our experimental assessment showed that the battery lifetime target for NB-IoT devices as stated by 3GPP utilizing latest-to-date Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) NB-IoT modules is yet to be realized. Finally, several recommendations on how to optimize the battery lifetime while designing firmware for NB-IoT device are also provided.},

abstract = {With the rapid advancement and development in the field of information and communication technologies, it is possible to enable doctors to employ technology in treating the patients. By employing the technology it is easier to treat patients quickly in emergency situations where the life can be saved if adequate medical assistance is provided in time. Based on the concept of telemedicine we have designed and developed a portable telemedicine system which is very compact, user friendly and economical. The portable telemedicine is very useful in the event of life threatening situations like heart attack (Strokes), instant high body temperatures, or abnormal BP conditions etc. Now-a-days there are several telemedicine systems available in the market. However, only a few are useful in the emergency situations. These systems are expensive and bulky and out of reach for most of the common people. The purpose of this paper is to come up with a new idea where these lifesaving telemedicine devices should become affordable for common people by making use of the latest prevailing technologies. In this paper we are going to introduce `Portable Emergency System' which is based on FTC - Find-Treat-Care technique. This system is designed with the integration of various technologies such as GSM/GPRS, GPS, sensors (wearable device) and P2P. The proposed new system will be useful for common people, during the emergency situations to diagnose the mobile heart (Cardiac) patients, diabetic patients, elderly people as well as an accident victim. The prime objective of the proposed new system is to provide urgent provisional medication and shifting of patient to the nearby hospital in time which can save the life of many people before the first contact with an expert doctor.},

abstract = {The emerging pervasive computing is regarded as a promising solution to the systems of personal healthcare and emergency aid, which can monitor personal health status in a real-time manner and automatically issue the alert for medical aids in case of emergency. However, the implementation of such a system is not trivial due to the issues, including (1) the system operations without complicated caregiver aid to reduce cost of human resource, (2) vital sensor deployment for user comfort, (3) on-site vital data process and storage for energy saving in data transmission, and (4) timely communication with healthcare centre for reporting users' health status and seeking urgent medical aids. In this paper, we propose a novel wearable personal healthcare and emergency aid system, namely WAITER. Our system does not require specific caregiver aid. WAITER just employs the tiny wearable sensors to continuously collect user's vital signals and Bluetooth device to transmit the sensory data to a mobile phone, which can perform on-site vital data storage and process. After local data process, the mobile phone can use its GSM module to periodically report users' health status to the healthcare centre and issue alert for medical aids once detecting emergency. We believe that WAITER can satisfy the requirements of real personal healthcare and emergency aid system.},

abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) is a way of connecting everything around us together, which would be widely applied in the 5G era. Narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) is one of the solutions introduced from 3{\textless}sup{\textgreater}rd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} Generation Partner Project (3GPP) Release-13 to fulfill this concept. Massive-connection and narrow band operation are two key features of NB-IoT. With current NB-IoT design, certain resources within narrow band are dedicated for transmitting paging information of massive connections. This leads to overload of the dedicated resources, and consequently increased padding bits and low resource efficiency. Moreover, UE power consumption would also rise due to the extra effort to decode larger packets. To solve above problems, a new resource allocation method is proposed, which includes a new definition of paging resource set and corresponding resource selection method. Link level simulation is conducted to show the benefit of our proposals. It is observed that approximately power consumption could be saved by 80{\%} and the resource efficiency could be improved by 30.5{\%} by utilizing our proposed methods.},

The only thought haunting every girl is when they will be able to move freely on the streets even in odd hours without worrying about their security. This paper suggests a new perspective to use technology for women safety. {\&}{\#}x201C;848 Indian Women Are Harassed, Raped, Killed Every Day!!{\&}{\#}x201D; That's a way beyond HUGE number! We propose an idea which changes the way everyone thinks about women safety. A day when media broadcasts more of women's achievements rather than harassment, it's a feat achieved!

We propose to have a device which is the integration of multiple devices, hardware comprises of a wearable {\&}{\#}x201C;Smart band{\&}{\#}x201D; which continuously communicates with Smart phone that has access to the internet. The application is programmed and loaded with all the required data which includes Human behavior and reactions to different situations like anger, fear and anxiety. This generates a signal which is transmitted to the smart phone. The software or application has access to GPS and Messaging services which is pre-programmed in such a way that whenever it receives emergency signal, it can send help request along with the location co-ordinates to the nearest Police station, relatives and the people in the near radius who have application. This action enables help instantaneously from the Police as well as Public in the near radius who can reach the victim with great accuracy.},

In the proposed work, two dipoles have been attached on different floating elements of a life jacket, in order to form a wearable emergency system that could be worn by any survivor. The two antennas are folded meandered dipoles operating at 406 MHz, center frequency of the Cospas sarsat system. A metallic sheet is used to shield the antennas from the human body and it is placed on the opposite side of the floating element with respect to each antenna. Antennas are linearly polarized with good impedance matching also when they are worn by the user, a wide radiation pattern beam and a high gain. Moreover they are orthogonal in order to form a diversity pattern transmitting system. Prototypes have been realized and a measurement campaign has been carried out showing good performance.},

Hence, they do not have in-the-lab measurement limitations and thus are ideal for ambulatory applications. However, due to the manufacturing process of MEMS sensors, existing wearable MoCap systems suffer from drift error and accuracy degradation over time caused by time-varying bias. The goal of this research is to develop algorithms based on multi-sensor fusion and machine learning techniques for precise tracking of human motion and location using wearable inertial sensors integrated with absolute localization technologies. The main focus of this research is on true ambulatory applications in active sports (e.g., skiing) and entertainment (e.g., gaming and filmmaking), and health-status monitoring. For active sports and entertainment applications, a novel sensor fusion algorithm is developed to fuse inertial data with magnetic field information and provide drift-free estimation of human body segment orientation. This concept is further extended to provide ubiquitous indoor/outdoor localization by fusing wearable inertial/magnetic sensors with global navigation satellite system (GNSS), barometric pressure sensor and ultra-wideband (UWB) localization technology. For health applications, this research is focused on longitudinal tracking of walking speed as a fundamental indicator of human well-being. A regression model is developed to map inertial information from a single waist or ankle- worn sensor to walking speed. This approach is further developed to estimate walking speed using a wrist-worn device (e.g., a smartwatch) by extracting the arm swing motion intensity and frequency by combining sensor fusion and principal component analysis.},

abstract = {In this paper, a multi antenna system mounted on a life jacket for human rescue Cospas Sarsat applications is described. The latter is intended to provide a earth to satellite SOS communication in case of shipwrecks or similar crashes and it is currently implemented in emergency devices like buoys. In the proposed work, two dipoles have been attached on different floating elements of a life jacket, in order to form a wearable emergency system that could be worn by any survivor. The two antennas are folded meandered dipoles operating at 406 MHz, center frequency of the Cospas sarsat system. A metallic sheet is used to shield the antennas from the human body and it is placed on the opposite side of the floating element with respect to each antenna. Antennas are linearly polarized with good impedance matching also when they are worn by the user, a wide radiation pattern beam and a high gain. Moreover they are orthogonal in order to form a diversity pattern transmitting system. Prototypes have been realized and a measurement campaign has been carried out showing good performance.},

abstract = {Detailed analysis on the impact of RF and channel impairments on the performance of Ultra-Wideband (UWB) wireless Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on the IEEE 802.15.3c standard, for high data-rate applications using the 60 GHz millimetre frequency band is presented in this paper. This frequency band, due to the large available bandwidth is very attractive for future and 5G wireless communication systems. The usage of OFDM at millimetre-wave (mmWaves) frequencies is severely affected by non-linearities of the Radio Frequency (RF) front-ends. The impact of impairments is evaluated, in terms of some of the most important key performance indicators, including spectral efficiency, power efficiency, required coding overhead and system complexity, Out-Of-Band Emissions (OOBEs), Bit Error Rate (BER) target and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Additionally, joint distortion effects of coexisting Phase-Noise (PN), mixer IQ imbalances and Power Amplifier (PA) non-linearities, on the performance degradation of a mmWave radio transceiver, combined with various multipath fading channels, are investigated. Subsequently, the power efficiency of the system is evaluated by estimating values of the PA Output-Power-Backoff (OBO) needed to meet the requirements for the Transmit Spectrum Mask (TSM) and BER target. Finally, a comparison of the system overall performance between uncoded and coded OFDM systems combined with Quadrature Amplitude Modulations (16 and 64 QAM) and its maximum operable range are evaluated by transmitting a Full HD uncompressed video frame under five different RF impairment conditions over a typical LOS kiosk 60 GHz IEEE channel model.},

Here, we present a system that was developed within the framework of the EU H2020 project IN LIFE to make the elderly feel more secure. The system consists of a smartwatch, a tablet, and a web portal for carers. The smartwatch has several functionalities; the most important are automatic fall detection, SOS button, communication with carers, location detection in case of emergency, and general activity monitoring. The smartwatch communicates with the server via GSM, therefore it does not depend on wireless internet or Bluetooth connection. The tablet acts as a virtual doorman and also as an interface for the carer, while the portal acts as a central information hub for notifications, scheduling of tasks, and user overview. We present the initial feedback from the users in a pilot study and discuss some modifications that we carried out considering this feedback.},

This system, named Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), can be deployed in three different operation modes - (1) stand-alone as a dedicated carrier, (2) in-band within the occupied bandwidth of a wideband LTE carrier, and (3) within the guard-band of an existing LTE carrier. In stand-alone operation mode, NB-IoT can occupy one GSM channel (200 kHz) while for in-band and guard-band operation modes, it will use one physical resource block of LTE (180 kHz). The design targets of NB-IoT include low-cost devices, high coverage (20-dB improvement over GPRS), long device battery life (more than 10 years), and massive capacity. Latency is relaxed although a delay budget of 10 seconds is the target for exception reports. The specifications for NB-IoT are expected to be finalized in 2016. In this paper, we describe the targets for NB-IoT and present a preliminary system design. In addition, coverage, capacity, latency, and battery life analysis are also presented.},

In normal situations, it is obvious that using a 1.4 MHz bandwidth in Long Term Evolution for Machines (LTE-M), helps in improving M2M device complexity, cost and battery life effectively. However, in emergency scenarios, an expected M2M storm will lead inevitably to a fast resource depletion accompanied by an eNodeB congestion in a split second. In this manuscript, we propose a novel scheme "LTE-M Adaptive eNodeB", which gradually solves the eNodeB overload problem, while keeping the H2H traffic QoS not to be affected badly. Moreover, We adaptively manage network resources to allow both traffic to efficiently access the LTE network via SimuLTE open-source modeler. Eventually, an evaluation of the mutual impact of M2M and H2H coexistence is also presented. Keywords— IoT, LTE-A, LTE-M, NB-IoT, LPWAN, M2M, H2H, SimuLTE, eNodeB, Overload Congestion Mechanism.},

abstract = {In this simulation work the coverage of GPRS, Narrowband-IoT, LoRa, and SigFox is compared in a realistic scenario, covering 7800 km2 and using Telenor's commercial 2G, 3G, and 4G deployment. The target is to evaluate which of the four technologies provides the best coverage for Internet of Things devices, which may be located deep indoor. The results show that Narrowband-IoT, having the best Maximum Coupling Loss performance of 164 dB, also provides the best coverage. This is despite the fact that LoRa and SigFox deployments with omnidirectional antennas are found to provide 3 dB lower link loss on average. In the deployment 11 {\%} of the geographical area contains devices, located both in rural and urban areas. The NB-IoT has an outage below 1 {\%} for locations experiencing 20 dB indoor penetration loss in addition to the outdoor path loss. SigFox performs similarly, while LoRa cannot provide coverage for 2 {\%} of those locations. For the challenging deep indoor case, where 30 dB additional penetration loss is expected, NB-IoT has 8 {\%} outage while SigFox and LoRa is unable to cover 13 {\%} and 20 {\%} of the locations. The four technologies may not be deployed at all existing site locations and therefore the work also includes a study of the coverage as a function of the minimum Inter-Site Distance, where sites closer than 2, 4, and 6 km are filtered out. The results show that SigFox and NB-IoT have outage probabilities below 5 {\%} even though sites closer than 4 km are removed from the simulations.},

abstract = {In this paper, a smart wearable health monitoring technology is presented with the GPS tracking ability for the children with autism. The main problem faced by the parents of an autistic child is to regular monitor the health condition of their children. An autistic child may have several health issues and requires constant monitoring of heart rate, pulse and body temperature but it is quite tough for parents and caretaker to measure health parameters regulary. Another acute problem is to keep tracking of the location of an autistic child whenever he or she is outside of the home without parents or caretakers. Conventional tracking devices have the limitation of small battery life. To overcome these problems, a wearable device is proposed which will be able to measure the temperature and pulse of the child and send notification with detailed information to the parents. The device will be able to detect the coordinates of it's user. Parents will have the ability to set parameters for a specific region of area. The device will send the coordinates of the child with regular notification and emergency alerts will be immediately notified whenever the pulse rate or temperature varies more or less than the standard value and whenever the child will be detected out of predefined coordinates. A wearable solar charging unit is proposed to overcome the limitation of small battery life so that the device will be always charged up whenever the child is traveling or outside of home.},

abstract = {Today in the current global scenario, the prime question in every girl's mind, considering the ever rising increase of issues on women harassment in recent past is mostly about her safety and security. The only thought haunting every girl is when they will be able to move freely on the streets even in odd hours without worrying about their security. This paper suggests a new perspective to use technology for women safety. {\&}{\#}x201C;848 Indian Women Are Harassed, Raped, Killed Every Day!!{\&}{\#}x201D; That's a way beyond HUGE number! We propose an idea which changes the way everyone thinks about women safety. A day when media broadcasts more of women's achievements rather than harassment, it's a feat achieved! Since we (humans) can't respond aptly in critical situations, the need for a device which automatically senses and rescues the victim is the venture of our idea in this paper. We propose to have a device which is the integration of multiple devices, hardware comprises of a wearable {\&}{\#}x201C;Smart band{\&}{\#}x201D; which continuously communicates with Smart phone that has access to the internet. The application is programmed and loaded with all the required data which includes Human behavior and reactions to different situations like anger, fear and anxiety. This generates a signal which is transmitted to the smart phone. The software or application has access to GPS and Messaging services which is pre-programmed in such a way that whenever it receives emergency signal, it can send help request along with the location co-ordinates to the nearest Police station, relatives and the people in the near radius who have application. This action enables help instantaneously from the Police as well as Public in the near radius who can reach the victim with great accuracy.},

In the proposed work, two dipoles have been attached on different floating elements of a life jacket, in order to form a wearable emergency system that could be worn by any survivor. The two antennas are folded meandered dipoles operating at 406 MHz, center frequency of the Cospas sarsat system. A metallic sheet is used to shield the antennas from the human body and it is placed on the opposite side of the floating element with respect to each antenna. Antennas are linearly polarized with good impedance matching also when they are worn by the user, a wide radiation pattern beam and a high gain. Moreover they are orthogonal in order to form a diversity pattern transmitting system. Prototypes have been realized and a measurement campaign has been carried out showing good performance.},

abstract = {Internet of things (IoT) is a way of connecting everything around us together, which would be widely applied in the 5G era. Narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) is one of the solutions introduced from 3{\textless}sup{\textgreater}rd{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} Generation Partner Project (3GPP) Release-13 to fulfill this concept. Massive-connection and narrow band operation are two key features of NB-IoT. With current NB-IoT design, certain resources within narrow band are dedicated for transmitting paging information of massive connections. This leads to overload of the dedicated resources, and consequently increased padding bits and low resource efficiency. Moreover, UE power consumption would also rise due to the extra effort to decode larger packets. To solve above problems, a new resource allocation method is proposed, which includes a new definition of paging resource set and corresponding resource selection method. Link level simulation is conducted to show the benefit of our proposals. It is observed that approximately power consumption could be saved by 80{\%} and the resource efficiency could be improved by 30.5{\%} by utilizing our proposed methods.},

abstract = {In this paper, a smart wearable health monitoring technology is presented with the GPS tracking ability for the children with autism. The main problem faced by the parents of an autistic child is to regular monitor the health condition of their children. An autistic child may have several health issues and requires constant monitoring of heart rate, pulse and body temperature but it is quite tough for parents and caretaker to measure health parameters regulary. Another acute problem is to keep tracking of the location of an autistic child whenever he or she is outside of the home without parents or caretakers. Conventional tracking devices have the limitation of small battery life. To overcome these problems, a wearable device is proposed which will be able to measure the temperature and pulse of the child and send notification with detailed information to the parents. The device will be able to detect the coordinates of it's user. Parents will have the ability to set parameters for a specific region of area. The device will send the coordinates of the child with regular notification and emergency alerts will be immediately notified whenever the pulse rate or temperature varies more or less than the standard value and whenever the child will be detected out of predefined coordinates. A wearable solar charging unit is proposed to overcome the limitation of small battery life so that the device will be always charged up whenever the child is traveling or outside of home.},

Therefore, there is a need to design a dependable embedded system device which will help in detecting the fall and further sends an emergency notification and thus helps in preventing the fall. Many researchers have considered human fall as an unpredictable danger to the life of older generation. Hence lot of research has been done in this area to develop a fall detection system. The existing fall detection systems are efficient but they lack in sensor optimization, early fall detection and efficient wireless communication. In this study, we have demonstrated a pre-fall detection system which detects human falls approximately 250 ms before it occurs. Early fall detection helps in preventing the subject from serious injuries. The designed system monitors user balanced and unbalanced state. Once the unbalance state is detected the system signifies it as a fall, thus gives milliseconds of time to trigger the safety devices like wearable airbag worn by a subject. On fall the system sends emergency notification to the care taker using either Internet of things (IoT) or Bluetooth low energy (BLE). The Hardware system is designed such that it consumes low power and it is a dependable embedded system with easy to wear capabilities for the subject. The designed system uses Arm Processor associated with motion sensors, communication sensors, Signal sensor and MicroSD Card. The software and hardware combination was developed to get optimal low power consumption by switching the CPU between active and sleep mode. The practical experiments performed on the designed system results in giving the 100{\%} sensitivity and 98.07{\%} specificity for fall detection. The wireless communication is efficiently designed such that the power is consumed only when the fall is triggered. The designed system acknowledges the difference - etween activity of daily living (ADL) like walking, sitting running, and climbing stairs with actual fall.},

abstract = {OAPA Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT) is the prominent technology that fits the requirements of future Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, due to the limited spectrum (i.e., 180 kHz) availability for NB-IoT systems, one of the key issues is how to efficiently use these resources to support massive IoT devices? Furthermore, in NB-IoT, to reduce the computation complexity and to provide coverage extension, the concept of time offset and repetition has been introduced. Considering these new features, the existing resource management schemes are no longer applicable. Moreover, the allocation of frequency band for NB-IoT within LTE band, or as a standalone, might not be synchronous in all the cells, resulting in intercell interference (ICI) from the neighbouring cells {\&} {\#}x2019; LTE users or NB-IoT users (synchronous case). In this paper, first a theoretical framework for the upper bound on the achievable data rate is formulated in the presence of control channel and repetition factor. From the conducted analysis, it is shown that the maximum achievable data rates are 89.2 Kbps and 92 Kbps for downlink and uplink, respectively. Secondly, we propose an interference aware resource allocation for NB-IoT by formulating the rate maximization problem considering the overhead of control channels, time offset and repetition factor. Due to the complexity of finding the globally optimum solution of the formulated problem, a sub-optimal solution with an iterative algorithm based on cooperative approaches is proposed. The proposed algorithm is then evaluated to investigate the impact of repetition factor, time offset and ICI on the NB-IoT data rate and energy consumption. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the non-cooperative, cooperative, and optimal scheme (i.e., no repetition) is also presented. It is shown through the simulation results that the cooperative scheme provides up to 8 {\&} {\#}x0025; rate improvement and 17 {\&} {\#}x0025; energy reduction as compared to the non-cooperative scheme.},

@article{Dongare2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Infrastructure monitoring applications currently lack a cost-effective and reliable solution for supporting the last communication hop for low-power devices. The use of cellular infrastructure requires contracts and complex radios that are often too power hungry and cost prohibitive for sensing applications that require just a few bits of data each day. New low-power, sub-GHz, long-range radios are an ideal technology to help fill this communication void by providing access points that are able to cover multiple kilometers of urban space with thousands of end-point devices. These new Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LPWAN) platforms provide a cost-effective and highly deployable option that could piggyback off of existing public and private wireless networks (WiFi, Cellular, etc). In this paper, we present OpenChirp, a prototype end-to-end LPWAN architecture built using LoRa Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN) with the goal of simplifying the design and deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices across wide areas like campuses and cities. We present a software architecture that exposes an application layer allowing users to register devices, describe transducer properties, transfer data and retrieve historical values. We define a service model on top of LoRaWAN that acts as a session layer to provide basic encoding and syntax to raw data streams. At the device-level, we introduce and benchmark an open-source hardware platform that uses Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) to help provision LoRa clients that can be extended with custom transducers. We evaluate the system in terms of end-node energy consumption, radio penetration into buildings as well as coverage provided by a network currently deployed at Carnegie Mellon University.},

abstract = {Today in the current global scenario, the prime question in every girl's mind, considering the ever rising increase of issues on women harassment in recent past is mostly about her safety and security. The only thought haunting every girl is when they will be able to move freely on the streets even in odd hours without worrying about their security. This paper suggests a new perspective to use technology for women safety. {\&}{\#}x201C;848 Indian Women Are Harassed, Raped, Killed Every Day!!{\&}{\#}x201D; That's a way beyond HUGE number! We propose an idea which changes the way everyone thinks about women safety. A day when media broadcasts more of women's achievements rather than harassment, it's a feat achieved! Since we (humans) can't respond aptly in critical situations, the need for a device which automatically senses and rescues the victim is the venture of our idea in this paper. We propose to have a device which is the integration of multiple devices, hardware comprises of a wearable {\&}{\#}x201C;Smart band{\&}{\#}x201D; which continuously communicates with Smart phone that has access to the internet. The application is programmed and loaded with all the required data which includes Human behavior and reactions to different situations like anger, fear and anxiety. This generates a signal which is transmitted to the smart phone. The software or application has access to GPS and Messaging services which is pre-programmed in such a way that whenever it receives emergency signal, it can send help request along with the location co-ordinates to the nearest Police station, relatives and the people in the near radius who have application. This action enables help instantaneously from the Police as well as Public in the near radius who can reach the victim with great accuracy.},
