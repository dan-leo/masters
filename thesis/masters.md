abstract: |
  This thesis aims to address current challenges in specific wireless wearable technology by using NB-IoT/LTE-M. Research and development will be geared towards senior citizens, children, hospital/clinic patients and vulnerable pedestrians. The device is intended to detect and report any of the following critical information using generic interfaces (I2C, digital IOs, UART, SPI): heart rate indicating health concerns, acceleration/jerk indicating falls or crashes, indoor localisation, body temperature, triggering of a panic button in case of emergency; whilst maintaining a discrete footprint. The solution will work in a similar way to the mobile phone app Namola, in which location info is sent to emergency responders. To conserve power, the transmission will be event-triggered, with optional infrequent polling from the server side. The idea would be to roll this out on a large scale, and for the application to choose one of the specific targets, e.g. only clinics, or only pedestrians.

# Literature Study

LTE Cat M1 and NB-IoT are two similar new technologies geared for the internet-of-things sector in the world. They occupy licensed spectrum in the cellular bands, which does mean that they're not free. However, one has the benefits of avoiding interference and a higher power throughput. There appears to be many applications which use networks such as GSM, Wifi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, etc, but not as many when it comes to LTE Cat M1/NB-IoT. In fact, quite often GSM is used for connectivity, and GPS for localization. In this paper, the plan is to improve on the commonly used GSM. The goal is to investigate the optimum feasibility/usage of LTE Cat M1/NB-IoT, and a single application will be developed as a case study. There is no merit to adding GPS to 'yet another project', unless it can be proved that it has great symbiosis with the proposed technologies. What is more interesting is what kind of localization one can achieve. There are basically two categories of indoor localization: model-based and fingerprinting-based. Model based uses geometrics relative to several known anchors, like RSSI, OTDoA and AOA which are more suitable in the line-of-sight (LOS). Of the fingerprinting approach, two algorithms emerge namely predictive and deterministic, which are more suited to multipath propagation in non line-of-sight (NLOS) environments. CSI fingerprinting is a pre-processing technique, but much better than the easiest and most common form -- RSSI trilateration. 

(insert (spider) diagram comparing network technologies weighted by coverage, throughput etc.)

NB-IoT is on par with SigFox in terms of coverage (no outage at 20 dBm indoor penetration loss), except that it has higher indoor penetration (8% outage at 30 dBm indoor penetration loss vs 13% and 20% for SigFox and LoRa respectively) and bandwidth [@Lauridsen2017]. It has a maximum-coupling-loss (MCL) of 164 dBm. Because it is a licensed frequency, it significantly exceeds LoRa's population coverage when it comes to rural and deep indoor areas [@Persia2017]. Current NB-IoT modules do not meet the battery lifetime target[^longevity_target] although several optimizations are recommended by [@Yeoh2018a].

It can be a rather utopian idea that there will be worldwide coverage of a LPWAN. 

[^longevity_target]: 10 years

## Localization

In the case of LoRaWAN, current hardware and software implementations limit timestamp resolution of time-of-flight (ToF) and time-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) schemes to 1 Âµsec, which limits localization accuracy to worse than 300 m [@Dongare2017].

There are a number of localized applications beneficial to health and safety. A GPS solar powered GSM wearable which monitors autism in children is proposed in [@Ahmed2017c], but lacks details on extending battery life, coverage etc. A thorough investigation in elderly assistance, including fall detection (also in @Chavan2017a), heartrate and movement activity, is proposed in [@Bizjak2017a].

PPG sensor to detect heart attacks as in [@Valliappan2017], also uses GSM. ZigBee to base station monitors chronic diseases for elderly patients [@Jian2010]. Vital signs are monitored and sent via bluetooth in [@Wu2008a], [@Kale2017a], [@Rathi2017] and in the form of jewellery in [@Patel2018].

Kalman filters in [@Wu2016]. Sarsat 406 MHz life jacket in [@Serra2011]. GSM and GPS Telemedicine in [@Suganthi.2012a] and [@Tewary2016b]. 

Autonomous emergency bracelet for women proposed in [@Harikiran2016]. 

NB-FI seems like an interesting UNB alternative to SigFox as it's bi-directional. There's a nice range calculator on http://waviot.com/technology/what-is-nb-fi. The main market of NB-Fi is the US and Russia where duty-cycle doesn't apply as in https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/forum/t/waviot-nb-fi-protocol-and-the-radio-transciever/5151.

When measuring differential temperature variations, if spikes in temperature variation were suppressed, one could use a rolling average instead.



# System Overview


# Testing

NB-IoT downloading was tested  on the Sierra Wireless 7702 using the following script.

```bash
while [ 1 ]; do	
    # wget --retry-connrefused --waitretry=1 
    # 	--read-timeout=20 --timeout=15 -t 0 --continue
    wget -t 0 -c http://speedtest.ftp.otenet.gr/files/test100k.db
    # check return value, break if not successful (0)
    if [ $? != 0 ]; then break; fi;
    sleep 1s;
done;
```

A 100 kb file is downloaded at a rate of around 3kB/s. The script continues download if stalled or other errors occur. Since it is a `Yocto` installation[^yocto], the other `wget` arguments were not available.

[^yocto]: It's not an embedded solution. Rather, it creates a custom one for you, regardless of hardware architecture [@yocto1]. 

After many failed attempts with the Ublox N200 version 01B and 02B on the ZTE eNodeB in Stellenbosch, not a single log was reported by Tektronix' NSA (Network & Service Analyzer / Network Spectrum Analyzer / Non-Standalone) Protocol Analyzer when attempting to register manually with the eNodeB's standalone NB-IoT cell.

There is an interesting problem where only one of the two sims provisioned for the B06009 eNodeB / Test Plant will register to MTN (65510). According to Michael, the one sim is probably out of the IMSI range. (NSA shows `network registration failed`)

The Sierra Wireless 7702 has a Qualcomm 9206 modem which supports LTE Cat M1, NB1 and EC-GSM.

Whenever any node in the network like UE/SGW/PGW fails to respond back for any of the request messages sent by MME, then MME will be rejecting the attach procedure with cause "network failure" after maximum retries of the request message.

When Mubanga Nsofu (from Qualcomm, sent by Arun Handoo and Hardik Shah) came in this morning, he connected the DM Port of the Sierra Wireless 7702 which has a Qualcomm 9206 modem to QPST which acts as an intermediary for QXDM. We were able to decode all RF logs. Strangely, the modem didn't want to connect to in-band NB-IoT this morning, but we could tell through the logs that it registers 5 times before being rejected by the MME (rejection cause 17: âNetwork failureâ [(Causes related to PLMN specific network failures and congestion / Authentication Failures) This cause is sent to the MS if the MSC cannot service an MS generated request because of PLMN failures, e.g. problems in MAP](https://stupidcaterpillar.wordpress.com/2011/07/20/cause-codes-from-network/)), and thus attempting via GSM as a fallback (which did still work).

His time was limited, so we left it at that, but he will be in Phase 1 tomorrow, and we can now do the tests properly. For example, attach latency under different conditions, cell-selection vs **re**selection etc.  NB-IoT (standalone, in-band), Cat M1 and GSM all still work again, since Michael and I reset the cells on the eNodeB.

Anyway, it would be nice to get cell-**re**selection working between NB1, M1 and GSM by adding `pr relationships` between neighbouring cells. Michael is trying to get some info from Ericsson, because he didn't find what he was looking for in the docs.

So far, cell-selection seems to work between NB1 in-band @953.36MHz and stand-alone @953.41MHz. It only takes about 10 seconds to switch between cells. There is also a little bit of interference there, which is noticeable when the ping tests stop at around -63dBm. I do struggle to get even just cell-selection to work between NB1 (in either mode), Cat M1 and GSM. According to Phillip New from Sierra Wireless, it does work. But I still think it's UE side problems. Furthermore, cell-**re**selection would be awesome on the live network, considering the dynamic localization use-case for my masters.

The eNodeB can read RF logs, but as Michael says, it crashes the server whenever they try to get it working (and this for the last few months). So yes, I will meet with Mubanga again tomorrow, and do some more tests, as well as seeing what is the problem when it comes to at least cell-selection.

The QXDM Professional software is also known as the Qualcomm eXtensible Diagnostic Monitor. It is a utility for those who have devices using Qualcomm ASICs and trial hardware, and allows them to test, evaluate and potentially diagnose issues in the RF performance of their mobile devices. It is often used in order to facilitate product development of these devices.

Using the software, users can see all the signaling messages made by their mobile devices, as the software generates a log of them. These logs can be annotated through the software as well. Any mix of network and phone parameters can be added to the screens, and users are allowed to use complex formulae when working with their parameters. Myriad statistical data is also generated by the program in real-time so that users can better identify potential performance issues. Users can access Markov statistics, Mux statistics, RLP statistics, the block error rate, mobility management data, paging and access statistics, forward and reverse link statistics, and more. The program also gives users a graphic display of the portable deviceâs signals. The program is compatible with Windows operating systems.

### Abstract

Emergency response mesh network.

Combine Namola and HayTag.

blockchain it possibly.

use stm32 2x2mm

Design a wearable with improved indoor positioning by using Dash7 RSSI trilateration engines and with NB-IoT/EC-GSM--assisted--satellite localization as a fallback. Physiological signals are monitored before and during emergency events to improve false positive detection.

* Is multi-modal localization necessary?
* Do mist-computing end-nodes have to be synchronized in, for example: critical events, multi-modal locations, and individual connection pairings? If so, a block-chain based approach can enhance the authenticity?

Bite-sized. Basically, the idea is to extend indoor positioning by using Dash7 RSSI trilateration engines with NB-IoT/EC-GSM--assisted--satellite localization as a fallback. Physiological signals are monitored before and during emergency events to improve false positive detection.



Need anchors which can be cellphones? Based

Unique direction finding?

### System Overview

* The system will use star or tree topologies, and mesh in edge cases.
* NB-IoT is used for assisted GNSS/GPS/Galileo and as a fallback for Dash7.

## Ideas

Ryan spoke to me. We had a great discussion. I need to paint my mind on a whiteboard, but for now I'll type here. NB-IoT not so good for emergency response. Better for monitoring. There are so many other things I can do, though. But in the end it's all about just passing the masters hey. So I do have a bunch of inside information, which could potentially be to my advantage. I'm stuck at a crossroads 3 months early says Ryan. He's looking at virtualization / SDN of MTN and 5G etc by 2022.

IoT stacks: Â IPSO-LWM2M/CoAP/UDP/6LoWPAN/6top/TSCH stack

- Wireless communications is a catalyst for **new intelligent applications such as localization and tracking**, providing real-time insights for contextual enablers. However,  current localization methods are either inaccurate, too costly, too energy hungry or not applicable for large-scale and challenging environments.
- **Resource constrained IoT devices & networks**: investigating ubiquitous solutions that transparently support a plethora of technologies (e.g., LoRa, DASH7, BLE, IEEE 802.15.4g), targeting co-creation of hardware prototyping and embedded protocol stack design as well as improved interactions with embedded devices.
- **Localisation & tracking:** localizing people and things in challenging environmental conditions by leveraging on off the shelf wireless technologies (a.o. UWB, Wi-Fi, Zigbee, BLE, Sigfox, DASH7) & through large-scale validations in testbeds.

GPS on a unidirectional LPWAN device with no ability to receive A-GPS ephemeris data means a cold startÂ *of several minutes*Â forÂ *each*Â acquisition of GPS coordinates.

# **DASH7 Was Designed for the Internet of Things!**

DASH7 is unlike any other wireless technology standard on the planet today. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/haytag-the-world-s-smartest-pet-tag#/

**â¢ Long range.**   DASH7âs range is many times greater than its next competitors, but also works so well indoors it makes meshing obsolete. DASH7âs range in the USA is between 200 meters and 1 kilometer, but in Europe, Australia, China, and many other markets, multi-kilometer ranges are easily achievable.

**â¢ Low power.**   DASH7 uses less than 1 milliwatt of power on average. No other low power wireless standard can offer full two-way, long range communications using a solar cell like DASH7.

**â¢ Instant-on.** DASH7 was designed to âlock onâ to fast moving things or people in ways that other wireless technologies cannot match. DASH7âs low latency is enabled through a unique query architecture that minimizes the elaborate hand-shaking typical in wireline-based protocols like IEEE 802.15.4, Bluetooth, or WiFi.

**â¢ Inexpensive.** DASH7 tags can be built very inexpensively using off-the-shelf components. DASH7âs firmware stack compiles into less than 20KB, enabling the use of lower cost silicon and minimal memory. DASH7 uses a license-free, globally available frequency, 433 MHz, which reduces the need for multiple SKUâs and simplifies interoperability across vendors.

**â¢ Open source.** There is nothing proprietary about DASH7, which is a complete open standard with open source firmware. No other wireless IoT technology in the world offers this same level of openness. There is even an industry consortium, the DASH7 Alliance, to ensure interoperability across DASH7 vendors. DASH7 was also built with interoperability at the forefront of our minds.

## Thoughts 

I'm still not sure what topic I'd like to investigate regarding NB-IoT. I like embedded development. My idea at the moment is to research and develop a localized wearable for emergency response purposes using LTE-NB2 or LTE-Cat-M2. It could potentially measure physiological signals such as heartrate and respiration, and/or dead reckoning using 9-axis measurements etc. But it feels more like an application that people out in business / in the field can do i.e. it doesn't feel very academic? I'd like something within Secondary research, not Primary, and not an application as it seems that I'm leaning towards. There is NB-IoT coverage in the area, and release 14 (NB2/M2) will be tested soon within a month or two. Release 13 (NB1/M1) is currently in place, which doesn't really allow for mobility / cell reselection.
