Hello Thinus, great to hear from you.



Glad to have these meetings again. Please excuse me if I'm a bit flustered, me and my girlfriend broke up after 6 months yesterday. It's for the best, though because now I can focus more on my masters again.

Sorry I missed the last week when you were still around. I went up the east coast for a while. I don't regret it and I learnt a great deal about relationships, but considering yesterday it felt like an investment down the drain. Well, time to focus more on myself and my masters.

So, last time we met you gave a brief structure to fill up, which in essence asks for the typical use cases of wearables, and requirements for wireless applications. Available tech. Choose a tech. NB-IoT. Choose a device.

Literature + Design Section.

I'll send it to you next week. At the moment I've taken over 200 papers on NB-IoT off IEEE Explore and am sifting each paper for information, because I want to know it extremely well.

I'm not ready to go to Joburg just yet. Unless at the end of Feb?

I can show them the tech I had at the demo with NB-IoT, SigFox, LoRAWAN and Dash7. A dashboard will show which technology is active at a time. I'll make a video of this as well, just in case of any technical difficulties.

Next, I'm going to build a wearable. An NB-IoT wearable. Although the theory tends to promote each technology, and like Thomas discovered in his thesis that there isn't enough field testing, testing the other technologies will justify why I only need to build an NB-IoT one.

I will 3D print a design. I don't want to look into localization too much as the scope is too broad. It is a topic in itself and expensive. Therefore, satellite tracking is sufficient.

Physiological signals.. will add something.

What will it prove? Proves that if NB-IoT is good for wearables, it can be used for many other things.

At the moment, one has to keep in close contact with people at large cellular providers.

Vodacom is rolling out a few hundred sites in Bloubergstrand and surrounds by March apparently. I asked them to activate one in Technopark, and it should be up and running any day now.

I was actually in their head office recently and spent a few hours testing there, but they had some problems with the base station. Then I went to the CTICC, and it worked perfectly.
