Hello Thinus.

I am a lot more focused than I have been before, and in fact I'm a little bit confused at the moment. So, SigFox and LoRaWAN are one way technologies. Because of that, they're very poor in the case of "where is my stuff". GPRS is old and battery hungry. That leaves NB-IoT and Dash7. Both of those I still like.

Do you think it's fine to put it into the literature that effectively there isn't enough testing to make a conclusive decision between NB-IoT and Dash7, and therefore I will develop both? There has been testing of LoRa and SigFox already in the 

I have the hardware, but I've been forcing myself to delve into the literature first. This is the fourth time I'm rewriting my work actually. It feels a lot more objective as well.. because I'm really trying to solve problem, and previously I was just doing things.

Also, thanks for the incentivized approach. I really like it. In fact, the survival money goes into res and the degree costs, and I'm forced to finish sections by the dates otherwise there's no payout.

Only concern is experimental results by April, but let it be.
