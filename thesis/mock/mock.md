# Holes in cheese affecting taste

Danny the manny. 2019

# abstract

during the production of cheese, holes of gases can form. These bubbles of gas can become trapped and feed the inhabiting cheese mites such that an uncharacteristically unbearable stench can occur. it is rare, but causes much consternation in the food industry. This papers outlines ways to combat the holes.

# intro

This paper is divided into three sections. The literature study will give the reader a background on the problem. The design section will show the steps to design a small scale solution. The analysis section processes the measurement data into an understandable outcome prove the concept.

# lit study

Cheese was invented in the early 500s BC. The first form was from goats and developed by early nomads on their journeys [1]. Today, cheese is predominantly derived from cow's milk. Of course, one can use soy milk, coconut milk and other forms as well. Milk can also be processed into yoghurt, feta, cream, etc an is included in many food products in industry.

Legend has it that the Swiss were the first to produce holes in their cheeses. The holes were effectively capsules of mighty air. Cheese mites gorge on the proteins in milk, which gives cheese its characteristic yellow colour. they also let off gases which gives cheese it's smell. Usually it's not a problem when trapped in the holes of cheese, but if the mites have been excited by a sugar overdose, there is a good chance that super mighty overpowering cheese smell can emanate from the hole, and incapacitate the beholding customer / userr [2].

To remove these holes, one can inject each hole with fresh air, or puncture them, but it is a time consuming task. A simpler solution is to stir the cheese during the production process to remove the holes.
