# Indoor-Outdoor

NB-IoT handles both, and Dash7 one of them

# Unified networking

Dash7 can be considered the bridge for IoT because it fills the gap between LPLAN and LPWAN.

# IoT backchannel

Useful security use case for NB-IoT and Dash7. Can also be used as a kill switch.

# Synchronization

TCP/IP is bad for time synchronization. Maintaining the same clock in endpoints is useful to schedule receive windows for downlink commands.

# Cellular IoT challenges

Cost and battery life. NB-IoT endpoint costs can be low in volume, and Vodacom has a competitive price point of 5 ZAR per month for an NB-IoT M2M sim. Ask MTN what they would offer?

# IoT cost

IoT infrastructure, security and lack of unified standards.

# IoT broadcasting

TCP/IP handles large data, but only between two devices. MQTT?

# LPWAN vs short range

Bluetooth dominates Personal Area Networks (PAN). If LPWANs can work well in local as well as wide area networks, then they will become dominant in future.

# LPWANs

Pick one that will survive

# 5G bad for IoT

Price,

# Blueborne

Bluetooth attack vector.

# LTE-M

high pwoer usage. price.

# NB-IoT positivity

China sells for cheap

# NB-IoT criticism

# Final thoughts

Geolocating.

# Asset tracking











iPhone + NFC can make Dash7 perhaps.

NB-IoT bad battery life?

1. NB-IoT can’t easily support “hot start” GPS location acquisition.
