abstract: |
  In critical use cases, localized wearables and assets require long-range bidirectional wireless networks such as GSM, NB-IoT and Dash7. Non-critical applications can make do with unidirectional LPWANs such as LoRaWAN and SigFox. This paper focuses on the requirements for critical IoT in a power efficient manner and in the indoor-outdoor realm.
