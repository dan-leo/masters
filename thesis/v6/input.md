## News

NB-IoT Release 14 modems have been released this 2019.

## NB-IoT new release overview

In LTE Release 14, NB-IoT has new features which include positioning, multicast, and a new UE output power class, whereas the system and UE throughput, non-anchor carrier operation, mobility, and service continuity are further enhanced [@Hoglund2017].

Furthermore, currently the work for LTE Release 15 NB-IoT is ongoing, and new features are introduced to further improve the NB-IoT battery life and latency and improve performance in more use cases [10].

## Indoor positioning

Do I want to talk about all the ways there are to do this? No.
