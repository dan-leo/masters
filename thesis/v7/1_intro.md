# Introduction

In recent years, 3GPP have developed new LPWANs for the cellular industry on the roadmap towards 5G, namely LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT and NB-IoT to supersede the sun-setting 2G/GPRS networks. GSM was first deployed in 1991 and offered calls and SMS as circuit switched data. In 2000, 2G/GPRS added internet at speeds comparable to dialup as packet switched data. Circuit switched data is ideal for real-time connections and means that links have bandwidth pre-allocated. This also increases the QoS guarantee of information transferred timeously. Packet switched data is connectionless on the other hand, with higher bandwidths possible in shared channels. GSM had been a cost-effective way to keep in touch with people around world, as well as the poorer communities in Africa. Due to the proliferation of WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram and other social media platforms, there is a shift away from calls and sms. 


## Key terminology

Channel coding

Rate Matching

Interleaving

The **PCI** value is created from two components - PSS and SSS. The PSS, Primary Synchronization Signal, has the value 0, 1, or 2. The SSS, Secondary Synchronization Signal, can have a value between 0 and 167.

The suppliers of UE will be referred to as manufacturers and of base-stations (BSS) as vendors.
