title: 3GPP Narrowband LTE evaluation for IoT in South Africa

abstract: |
  2G/GPRS is a sun-setting technology leaving behind a void for LPWANs such as LoRaWAN and SigFox to fill. The viability of NB-IoT being such a technology for South Africa is investigated. Multiple endpoint manufacturers and base station vendors are tested to compare capabilities with respect to cost, time, power consumption and signal strength. The results proved promising.

# Discussion

Paging the base station?

Initial ping takes longer than the rest? Should one rebuild the ping test to make it more generic? What does a ping test look like?

When R14 is released, does it have backwards compatibility with R13?

There is a a certain range from the base station where the dev kit disconnects from the base station with attenuator and without antenna.

It seems that signal does poorly when passing through hills?

# (Things to keep in mind)

* Whatever your structure, there must be a logical progression of
  thought
* Think with the critic’s cap on – anticipate criticisms and proactively
  protect thesis from them. Also write thesis from reader’s
  perspective
