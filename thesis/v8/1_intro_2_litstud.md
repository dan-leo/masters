# Abstract {-#abstract}

2G/GPRS is a sun-setting technology leaving behind a void for LPWANs such as LoRaWAN and SigFox to fill. The viability of NB-IoT being such a technology for South Africa is investigated. A number of telemetry tests have been performed for multiple UEs (Ublox and Quectel), LTE vendors (ZTE, Nokia, Ericsson and Huawei) and MNOs (MTN and Vodacom) at different RF attenuation decades. This has resulted in analysis for metrics such as latency and power efficiency, as well as estimates for telemetry periodicity and battery longevity.

# Introduction {#intro}

Narrowing the spectrum bandwidth for cellular Long Term Evolution (LTE) used in everyday life results in a low data-throughput and low energy technology which matches the requirements for wireless Internet of Things (IoT), hence the name "Narrow-band IoT" (NB-IoT).

This chapter introduces various concepts relating to NB-IoT and the performance characteristics thereof. It begins with the question "Why NB-IoT?" before developing the research question, objectives, scope, terminology, background and other various related concepts to fully orientate the reader with regards to NB-IoT.

## Background {#background}

In recent years, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) developed new low-powered wide-area networks (LPWANs) for the cellular industry on the roadmap towards 5G, namely LTE Cat-M, EC-GSM-IoT and NB-IoT to supersede the sun-setting 2G/GSM/GPRS networks.

### Why NB-IoT? {#why}

As aforementioned, NB-IoT fills the role 2G/GPRS leaves behind as countries around the world schedule its departure. The LTE-based technology shows performance benefits over alternative LPWANS in terms of up and downlink throughput, range and longevity, yet current research shows that variation in energy consumption leaves battery longevity in question. Nevertheless, according to 3GPP specifications and manufacturer claims, highlights include:

* ~ 10 year battery-lifetime.
* Under 10 second transmission acknowledgement for latency-tolerant applications
* \+ 20 dB improvement over 2G/GPRS via enhanced coverage levels (ECL).

Despite these highlights, it would nevertheless be significant to further investigate variation in energy consumption, latency, signal strength and battery longevity of the technology to solidify the robustness of these claims both on the sides of user equipment (UE) and network vendors. Other metrics such as throughput, data overhead and estimated telemetry interval would show the effect of network characteristics on the technology.

### History and Development

The beginnings of these new cellular LPWANs started when GSM was first deployed in 1991 and offered calls and SMS as circuit switched data. In 2000, 2G/GPRS added internet at speeds comparable to dialup as packet switched data. Circuit switched data is ideal for real-time connections and means that links have bandwidth pre-allocated. This also increases the QoS guarantee of information transferred timeously. Packet switched data is connectionless on the other hand, with higher bandwidths possible in shared channels. In Fig. \ref{fig:2G_LTE_transition}, we see how technologies using 2G/GSM/GPRS transitioned to LTE. With regard to using the 'internet' for communication, emails, WAP and other 'web-based' forms of messaging were used to keep in touch. Over time, we moved to a plethora of IMS platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram and WeChat to name a few. Machine-to-machine (M2M) is the direct exchange of information without human intervention, both wired and wirelessly. Whilst the world has come a long way from its analog roots such as the telephone, cellular M2M emerged in 1995 with Siemens creating a GSM module for machines to use wireless networks. Even to this day, SMS, USSD and 2G/GPRS is still used, but with the advent of LPWANs we have even more to choose from including LoRaWAN, SigFox and cellular-based forms such as NB-IoT.

Grey for internet-based communications and white for circuit-switched. \label{fig:2G_LTE_transition}](C:\GIT\masters\thesis\images\ims voip.jpg){ width=50% }

In South Africa, there is a push by cellular service providers to adopt a cellular LPWAN to fill the void that 2G/GPRS leaves behind now and in the future. NB-IoT is being investigated by MTN South Africa, and since they are also funding this research, have also provided network coverage for testing to Stellenbosch University. Ideally, the technology can be rolled out to existing base stations as a software upgrade for national coverage, but it is limited by factors such as use case demand, expensive licensing and general uncertainty about the technology.

2G/GPRS has served as the gateway for smart devices and sensors in the M2M sphere for many years, but due to its high-powered usage it is not sustainable for applications which require battery longevity of up to 10 years or more. In lieu of its absence, although the spectrum it held can be re-farmed for cellular LPWANs, it also opens up opportunities for market entrants of unlicensed frequencies such as LoRaWAN and SigFox. Each LPWAN technology has its own unique flaws and benefits and there is yet to be a clear winner when it comes to connecting 'things' to the internet [@Thomas2018].

When considering rolling out more coverage, since NB-IoT is based on LTE, it makes integration and upgrading of existing infrastructure more seamless than an entirely separate technology. Although NB-IoT still retains the drawbacks and complexities of legacy LTE such as the vast array of sub-protocols and communication overhead, this still includes the low power, low bandwidth benefits and others which match the requirements for smart devices and IoT. It should be mentioned that much of the RF spectrum which can be used for digital communications is still used by analogue television broadcast in South Africa by the SABC. ICASA, who controls the spectrum, can solve this issue but over the years they have been a strong limiting factor in the slow release of new spectrum to large mobile-network-operators (MNOs). This has been the case for approximately 16 years to date, and ICASA has instead released spectrum to smaller players such as Rain Ltd, Liquid Telecom and Telkom. To increase demand for application developers in IoT, because they will be interested in a hands-on approach with the technology they will use, more network coverage is necessary to scale up production such that volumes of 1000 devices or more can be connected.

### Terminology {#terminology}

Because the nature of this thesis provides many broad concepts and complex terms, this section briefly introduces to the reader various IoT, LPWAN and LTE related topics expanded upon in the rest of the thesis. The background of NB-IoT is discussed in \S\ref{background}.

The Internet of Things (IoT in \S\ref{iot}) is a blanket term for smart devices that connect to the internet. These devices are typically found in remote or urban areas where it would be more efficient for a device to control and monitor the status of the surrounding environment than human intervention. 

Smart devices or 'things' can connect to the internet by wire or wirelessly. Wired devices usually connect using ethernet, although it is not uncommon to use industry grade protocols such as RS232, CAN, ModBus, ProffiBus, and so on before data reaches a network hub and the internet. Wireless connections, on the other hand, have the benefit of easy installation and really shine in inaccessible areas. It is quite effective to connect Bluetooth and WiFi for short range applications, or using Low Powered Wide Area Networks (LPWANs in \S\ref{lpwans}) such as LoRaWAN, SigFox and NB-IoT for ranges exceeding a few kilometers and especially for limited sources of power.

Considering how LPWANs usually fill niche applications and just looking in terms of modulation differences, Long-Range Radio (LoRa or LoRaWAN in \S\ref{unidirectional_lpwans}) uses chirp-spread-spectrum (CSS) modulation to make it quite immune to doppler effect motion and SigFox (\S\ref{unidirectional_lpwans}) uses binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) in an ultra-narrow band, which increases noise immunity, but devices cannot move more than 6 km/h. LPWANs enable many use cases (\S\ref{usecases}) such as remote sensing, actuator control and asset/location tracking.

GSM and GPRS fall under 2G and 2.5G which started development in the early 90s. Data transmission (such as USSD, SMS, WAP, IP) is circuit-switched over GSM, and packet-switched over GPRS. Circuit switched data is billed per time interval such as seconds or minutes, and packet-switched is charged per number of bytes (kB, MB, etc.). It evolved into 3G in Release 99 at the turn of the millenium and 4G/LTE in Release 8 (Q4 2008).

Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a cellular broadband technology that is a subset of an even more complex 3GPP governing body that guides its development. In LTE, the narrowband category is known as LTE Cat-NB or NB-IoT. LTE Cat-M is designated for M2M applications, and although it is quite similar to NB-IoT, it features VoIP, faster throughput and is more similar to the LTE protocol. Unfortunatly it is not considered in South Africa. There are two different versions of NB-IoT, with LTE Cat-NB1 being release 13 and LTE Cat-NB2 being release 14. Their specifications have been frozen in Q1 2016 and mid-2017, respectively, with LTE Cat-NB1 in South Africa.

## Project Description {#proj_descr}

### Problem Statement {#probstat}

NB-IoT has unique features that hold a competitive advantage over alternatives such as LoRaWAN, SigFox and other LPWANs, however it does not have a strong uptake in South Africa yet. Most notably, NB-IoT offers energy efficient bidirectionality (as opposed to the uplink-centric norm) using extended discrete periodic reception (eDRX), yet variation in transmission energy and latency can affect battery lifetime drastically. Application developers require network coverage before they are interested in developing business cases, and cellular service providers require consumer and enterprise demand or business cases before rolling out national network coverage. This creates a paradoxical situation where neither party gives in unless they are both willing to come to a compromise. Such efforts can be limited by a lack of understanding in the technology, and this is not helped by the fact that although there is a great deal of theoretical analysis and simulations in research, the lack of empirical evidence may be contributing to a general uncertainty in the standing of the technology with respect to alternatives and thus a slower adoption. This thesis aims to bridge that divide in South Africa by evaluating NB-IoT's performance empirically using a set of metrics and estimate optimal use.

### Research Objectives {#resobj}

This study has the following aims:

* Latency, power efficiency and other metrics of NB-IoT are to be evaluated using a set of telemetry tests.

  

* User equipment (UE) devices will be compared against multiple LTE vendors used by mobile network operators (MNOs) exposing the change in variability due to proprietary LTE complexities.

  

* Battery longevity and recommended telemetry intervals are estimated, and other secondary metrics such as signal strength, throughput and data overhead are investigated.

  

In turn, the above objectives evaluate the robustness, stability, capabilities, sources of variability and claimed versus actual core features of NB-IoT.

This thesis aims to highlight the advantages, disadvantages and challenges of NB-IoT. By doing endpoint tests between UE devices and multiple LTE base station vendors, one can paint an accurate picture of the capabilities of the technology as rolled out in South Africa.

### Scope of Work {#scopework}

Although there exists a multitude of UE devices, LTE vendors, estimations and metrics, the study will be limited to the following as seen in Table \ref{tbl:metric_summary} and \ref{tbl:telemetry_ue_lte}.

While theoretical models provide value in showing how factors affect an approximation, the boundless underlying complexities of LTE architecture make it hard to predict the variability induced by unpredictable network conditions. Thus, an empirical approach is proposed. Since the energy efficiency of a single network is already in question by the results generated by Durand [@Durand2019], Martinez [@Martinez2019] and affected by latency, these will form the main metrics investigated in this study.

Table: Metrics and Estimations {#tbl:metric_summary}

| Main Metrics     | Secondary Metrics      | Estimations         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Power Efficiency | Signal Strength        | Battery Longevity   |
| Latency          | Throughput             | Telemetry Intervals |
|                  | Data Overhead          |                     |
|                  | Coverage Levels (ECLs) |                     |

Table: Telemetry Types, UE devices and LTE vendors {#tbl:telemetry_ue_lte}

| Telemetry Types | LTE Vendors | UE Manufacturers |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| UDP Packets     | ZTE         | Ublox            |
| eDRX and PTAU   | Nokia       | Quectel          |
| COPS            | Ericsson    | Nordic           |
| Data Echo       | Huawei      | SimCom           |

The capture method should be easily repeatable and expandable for new UE devices. On the basis that the AT command API is familiar to all UE devices, a framework will be built to extract data via this method. Although all UE devices are usually accessible through AT commands, there are alternative diagnostic methods such as Qualcomm QXDM, UEMonitor and an opensource decoder by LanternD which monitors the debug stream provided over UART at 921600 baud. QXDM is a proprietary diagnostic program built for UE devices with Qualcomm chipsets, yet it costs in excess of a few thousand USD. UEMonitor is free and can capture debug traces from both Ublox and Quectel. LanternD's decoder is still in beta and thus unstable. Since both Ublox and Quectel's debug messages can be accessed by UEMonitor and LanternD, these UE devices will be used to compare LTE Vendors. There is no support or alternative for Nordic or SimCom devices, however.

## Project Overview {#overview}

This section looks at how user equipment (UE devices in \S\ref{ue_devices}) is compared against multiple LTE vendors (\S\ref{lte-vendors}) operated by mobile network operators (MNOs in \S\ref{MNOs}) which expose the change in variability due to proprietary LTE complexities. These comparisons are made according to a set of metrics, estimations (\S\ref{metrics_est}) and telemetry tests (\S\ref{telemetry_tests}).

\hypertarget{MNOs}{%

<!--### MNOs: MTN and Vodacom {#MNOs}-->  

The following MNOs have NB-IoT coverage in South Africa which will be expanded upon in \S\ref{coverage}, namely MTN and Vodacom. NB-IoT uses their LTE infrastructure, and this will be expanded upon in \S\ref{lte-vendors}.

MTN Group Limited, formerly M-Cell, is a South African multinational mobile telecommunications company, operating in many African countries and the Middle East. Its head office is in Johannesburg. 

Vodacom Group Limited is a South African mobile communications company, providing voice, messaging, data and converged services to over 55 million customers part of the international Vodafone Group.

\hypertarget{lte-vendors}{%

<!--### LTE Vendors: ZTE, Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei {#lte-vendors -->

Table \ref{tbl:telemetry_ue_lte} gives the following LTE vendors which are among the top 5 in the world: Huawei, Ericsson, Nokia and ZTE. Since there are over a hundred MNOs across the world which also use these LTE vendors, performing this study on the main LTE vendors will also benefit the MNOs. With regard to NB-IoT connectivity on MNOs in South Africa, MTN will be used for ZTE and Ericsson, and Vodacom will be used for Nokia and Huawei.

In South Africa, there are two mobile network operators trialing NB-IoT and combined they use four of these top LTE vendors. Samsung has started using NB-IoT only as recently as May 2019, announcing a partnership with [KT to create a Public Safety](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20190506/nb-iot/samsung-kt-launch-nbiot-service-through-ps-lte-network-korea) (PS-LTE) network. They're also implementing device-to-device (D2D) communications to increase connectivity in unfavourable conditions.

<!--### UE Device Manufacturers: Ublox, Quectel, Nordic, SimCom {#ue_devices}-->

Finally, with regard to the UE devices in \ref{tbl:telemetry_ue_lte}, application developers are likely to use more popular NB-IoT module manufacturers such as Ublox, Quectel, Nordic and SimCom, besides lesser known ones such as Telit, Sierra Wireless, Gemalto, and akorIoT. 

UE devices specifically used:

- Ublox Sara N200
- Quectel BC95

and the following recommended in future:

- Nordic nRF9160
- SimCom SIM7020E
- Mediatek MT2625
- Sierra Wireless 7702

Although LTE vendors are open to all UE manufacturers, mobile network operators (MNOs) are still in control of LTE vendor equipment and some aspects of UE devices via RF signalling. Thus it is important for MNOs to recognize the effect they have on the technologies they use, especially when it differs from theory.

These UEs all share AT commands as the API to control their capabilities.

\hypertarget{metrics_est}{%
\subsubsection[Metrics and Estimations: Power, Latency, Secondary and Interval, Longevity]{Metrics and Estimations}\label{metrics_est}} 

<!--### Metrics and Estimations: Power, Latency, Secondary and Interval, Longevity {#metrics_est}-->

Considering metrics and estimations in Table  \ref{tbl:metric_summary} above, a more comprehensive study has been performed on throughput, packet delivery ratio (PDR), maximum coupling link (MCL) and scalability by Durand [@Durand2019]. Martinez has investigated the performance boundaries of NB-IoT for a Vodafone network in Barcelona, Spain [@Martinez2019] including metrics such as energy consumption, transmission delay, enhanced coverage levels (ECLs) and different data sizes. Because power efficiency and latency is significantly affected by variability, important considerations have to be made in application development and thus it is of the main metrics this study is focused on. Between UE devices and LTE basestations (BTS) both signal strength (RSRP) and coverage enhancement levels (ECL) can be causes of variability. 

In terms of estimations, variability affects battery lifetime and telemetry interval amongst others. Battery lifetime is defined as the length of time a device will last on an AA battery in years. Telemetry interval is defined as the periodicity time between different types of messages to last a year on an AA battery. These two estimations are necessary for developers to consider in battery-powered applications and form an important basis for this study.

\hypertarget{telemetry_tests}{%
\subsubsection[Telemetry Tests: UDP, Echo, COPS, eDRX, PTAU]{Telemetry Tests}\label{telemetry_tests}}

<!--### Telemetry Tests: UDP, Echo, COPS, eDRX, PTAU {#telemetry_tests}-->

The different types of telemetry messages in Table \ref{tbl:telemetry_ue_lte} include UDP datagram transmission, cellular operator selection (COPS), UDP Echo, extended discontinuous reception (eDRX) and periodic tracking area updates (PTAU). UE devices usually give the option of using the following main data transmission protocols: UDP, TCP, CoAP and MQTT. UDP is a connectionless protocol used for low latency applications and TCP is used to stream data orderly, reliably, but at a cost to data overhead.  CoAP and MQTT are lightweight message transfer protocols based off of UDP and TCP respectively. To measure the data overhead secondary metric caused by network repetitions and other mechanisms, it would be preferable to avoid overhead from other protocols and thus the simplest option is chosen, namely UDP. 

## Network Coverage Worldwide {#coverage}

Although NB-IoT joined LPWANs circa 2016-2017, world-wide coverage is still growing. This can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:worldwide_coverage}.  [AT&T announced](https://blog.nordicsemi.com/getconnected/att-launches-nb-iot-network-in-usa) nation-wide coverage of NB-IoT in the USA, alongside its existing LTE Cat-M coverage. Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone cover Europe and China enables millions more IoT devices [@china2019].

### Connectivity in South Africa {#connectivity}

In South Africa, NB-IoT has most of its coverage in the Gauteng province as well as a few sites in other towns and cities. Although Gauteng only covers 1.49% of the land mass in South Africa, it holds ~22% of its ~57 million people so understandably it is great as a live trial run before pushing for national coverage.

To connect via NB-IoT on the Vodacom network, sim cards must be purchased with a M2M contract over 24 months at 5.00 ZAR/month. At the time of registering in this study, data bundles range from 5 Mb for 7.50 ZAR to 30 Mb for 29.00 ZAR.

MTN NB-IoT sim cards can currently be obtained only for testing purposes, and it would be best to speak directly to MTN.

# Literature Study {#litstudy}

This chapter will look at NB-IoT performance-related literature, IoT, LPWANs, use cases, and a deeper look into NB-IoT itself.

## Related Literature

Considering current literature, several studies provide theoretical models not only for the energy consumption of NB-IoT networks [@Andres-Maldonado2017], but also for their latency and delay bounds [@Feltrin2019], impact of coverage extensions [@Andres-Maldonado2018b], coverage performance [@Adhikary2016], battery lifetimes [@Yeoh2018d],[@Lauridsen2018], theoretically optimal configuration strategies [@Feltrin2018] and overall performance for particular verticals [@Soussi2018],[@Beyene2017b].

Only Martinez [@Martinez2019] focuses effort on the adopter and presents an operational and empirical analysis of the technology when it is deployed in a real network (such as Vodafone in the Metropolitan area of Barcelona). Durand [@Thomas2018] compares different LPWANs empirically including NB-IoT. Despite the unquestionable value of the theoretical models (for example, to understand orders of magnitude or to guess the theoretical upper and lower bounds), an empirical approach provides real insights into the variability that a UE device experiences when deployed in real conditions. This work therefore complements Martinez and related works, and it further provides empirical measurements for UEs that are deployed using a real-world NB-IoT network always while taking the perspective of an application developer.

Whilst this research is funded by MTN and being aware of internal documentation, this is an independent study which should aid any potential adopters of the technology.

## Internet of Things{#iot}

The Internet of Things (IoT), as briefly outlined in \S\ref{terminology}, is an ecosystem of smart devices that connect to the internet/cloud in various ways. Although IoT's requirements (\S\ref{iot_requirements}) are loosely defined due to the large variety of use cases (\S\ref{usecases}), it is still important to see how well NB-IoT performs and facilitates these connections for IoT (discussion in \S\ref{discussion}). This section looks at these requirements and other facets of IoT relevant to NB-IoT.

Since IoT is advancing in popularity (\S\ref{iot_requirements}), stakeholders in NB-IoT can be rest assured that the technology will be useful for years to come.

Although the simplest type of use case is smart metering (\S\ref{smartmetering}), useful for LPWANs which send data unidirectionally, NB-IoT shows its bidirectional strength in Push-Pull models (\S\ref{pushpull}). In fact, this makes NB-IoT well suited for edge computing (\S\ref{pushpull}) too.

Finally, although satellite IoT has the benefit of worldwide coverage, by rolling out national NB-IoT coverage in South Africa, for example, it defeats the purpose of satellite IoT by being affordable and energy efficient (see \S\ref{satellite_iot}).

### Requirements and Advancement {#iot_requirements}

IoT requires scalable smart devices to collect data and interact with the physical world using wireless connectivity. Thus, wireless communication must be energy efficient, have low latency, low data overhead and long range for optimal cloud processing. To be sure that LPWANs can be well scaled, they require a cloud platform well suited to the large number of connections such as Cisco-Jasper and ThingsBoard [@Hejazi2018a].

<!-- ### Advancement {#iot_advancement} -->

IoT has surged in popularity over recent years as an interconnected system of devices that transfer data over a network without requiring human interaction.

Looking at Gartner's analysis of technology expectations with regards to NB-IoT and related technologies, in 2014 Gartner estimated that Internet of Things (IoT) had reached the height of inflated expectations, and the hype it generated lives on in a rich ecosystem of emerging technologies. As of July 2018, NB-IoT and IoT has falling interest (and hype) in Fig. \ref{fig:gartner_ictAfrica}, yet it will reach productivity in 2-10 years time. Since new coverage has not been rolled out for almost two years to date, we believe there is a strong chance for renewed NB-IoT interest in Africa. Gartner predicts that there will be more than 20.8 billions of smart things that will be connected to Internet by 2020, whereas the worldwide number of devices was 6.4 billions in 2016 [@Ayoub2018c].

[](../images/hype-cycle-2014-100371840-large.idge.jpeg)

![Gartner's [2018 Hype Cycle for ICT in Africa](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3884512). NB-IoT is high on the list of expectations. \label{fig:gartner_ictAfrica}](../images/42881085945_739bbdc8e9_c.jpg){ width=90% }

As of August 2019, Gartner has high expectations for 5G and other emerging technologies which can make use of what [IoT has to offer](https://blogs.sas.com/content/hiddeninsights/2016/07/06/long-live-the-iot-hype/). This can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:gartner_emergingTech}.

![Gartner's Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2019. IoT is inextricably linked to at least a third of emerging technologies and also has uses in NB-IoT. \label{fig:gartner_emergingTech}](../images/CTMKT_741609_CTMKT_for_Emerging_Tech_Hype_Cycle_LargerText-1.png){ width=85% }

On the other hand, this does not slow the growth in number of devices connected as in Fig. \ref{fig:iot_growth}. IoT merely manifests itself in other uses and forms such as we have already seen in Fig. \ref{fig:gartner_emergingTech}. NB-IoT can be integral to aid this growth.

![Exponential growth of IoT is estimated [@Ali2015]. \label{fig:iot_growth}](../images/Expected-number-of-connected-devices-to-the-Internet-This-chart-is-obtained-from-recent.png){ width=80% }

Matching emerging applications with existing technologies has become one of the
main challenges for IoT initiatives, especially when a new technology appears in the landscape and the map must be redrawn. Massive IoT is the deployment of an immense number of low-powered devices with infrequent reporting and both NB-IoT and LTE Cat-M fulfill the requirements of 5G massive MTC/IoT.

### Push-Pull Model and Edge/Fog Computing {#pushpull}

Traditionally, IoT devices push data to the internet at regular intervals. This push model can be considered quite energy inefficient, especially when the data is only occasionally actionable. For example, in asset tracking or remote monitoring.

A pull model is ideal for dynamic rule engines, pulling data only when necessary and ultimately edge computing, where building an application around this idea can greatly enhance battery life.

Most LPWANs are unidirectional, meaning they transmit data in one direction only. This is especially true in the case of LoRaWAN and SigFox and means they use a push model. A push model is bad for the battery when periodically sending data. It does help to make the data transmissions event-based, however. NB-IoT and Dash7 for example, are bidirectional which means they can stay quiet for longer and only send data on-demand ~ when it is needed. This would make it a pull model and is useful for critical use cases as well [@Mekki2018a].

Table: Unidirectional and bidirectional LPWANs {#tbl:unibidirectional_lpwans}

| Unidirectional | Bidirectional  |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| SigFox         | NB-IoT         |
| LoRaWAN        | EC-GSM-IoT     |
| NB-Fi          | RPMA           |
|                | Weightless SIG |
|                | Dash7          |
|                | WiFi HaLow     |

Most importantly when looking at bidirectionality vs unidirectionality is that transmit current is usually much more than the receive current required. By limiting TX transmissions such that the user only requests data on-demand when it is required, battery savings ensue. There are many LPWANs out there, but we can split them up into two groups as in Table \ref{tbl:unibidirectional_lpwans}. Later, we look at a few of these directional LPWANs in \S\ref{unidirectional_lpwans}-\ref{bidirectional_lpwans} and draw comparisons in \S\ref{lpwan_comparison}.

<!-- ###  Edge/Fog Computing {#edge_computing} -->

---

Edge computing is the practice of offloading cloud processes to the endpoint. It saves on data overhead, especially when there are data charges involved and battery longevity is desired.

Since NB-IoT is optimized for downlink communications, it can be the ideal candidate. Downlink communications use much less energy than uplink, and at higher throughput too. Usually data has to be periodically sent to the cloud in unidirectional networks and processing done thereafter, but with the push-pull model, one can send a specialized request and devices can send back processed data, saving energy and lowering data costs, hence edge computing.

Fog computing is considered a good solution to address the demand for massive connections and low-latency applications by pushing some computing or processing tasks from the cloud servers to the Fog nodes, or close to the mobile edge. A Fog node can be viewed as a reduced capability of a cloud server and/or integrated with a small cell for handling the telecommunication services. There are several potential applications of the Fog computing node technology associated with NB-IoT small cell and the cloud services for smart parking, smart home, and smart retail and delivery services [@Chang2017].

### Satellite IoT {#satellite_iot}

The potential use of constellations of satellites for IoT applications is of growing interest. With booming development in the IoT sector and as a powerful supplement to terrestrial systems, LEO constellation-based IoT is worth being focused and studied. To make this topic become a reliable cost-benefit solution, further research is required in transmission scheme, system security and low power consumption design. [@Qu2017c]

Compared to LPWANs, Satellite IoT has global coverage. In terms of packet payload size, a typical system such as the Iridium 9602/9603 will transmit up to 270 bytes or receive 340 bytes via AT commands. A supercapacitor is necessary for the initial 7.5W burst for 10ms which opens a session, and with an open sky messages can be sent every 10 seconds. It even features a 'Ring Alert' feature, similar to eDRX in NB-IoT in that modems listen for when incoming messages are available, for satellites to page a modem when a mobile terminated (MT) message is available from an internet-facing endpoint. Although Ring Alerts are sent to the position of the last known transmission, an Iridium satellite spot beam is about 400km in diameter meaning devices would have to travel quite far before requiring a simple re-registration transmission. The greatest drawback is the upfront, rental and per byte costs looking at \pounds159, \pounds12/month and \pounds0.14 per 50 byte credit respectively on Rock Seven Mobile Services Ltd, and the high power draw compared to NB-IoT.

NB-IoT is not the only network that can replace satellite IoT or 2G/GPRS with coverage in broad areas (ideally nationally), and this will be explored further in \ref{lpwans}.

## Low-Powered Wide-Area Networks {#lpwans}

A low-power wide-area network is a type of wireless telecommunication designed to allow long-range communications at a low bit rate among things, such as sensors operated on a battery. This section will compare a few prominent cellular and unlicensed frequency LPWANs against NB-IoT besides the following alternatives:

* EC-GSM-IoT is a form of eGPRS optimized for the IoT. It is still in the trial stages of development, however [@Bergman2017].
* RPMA by Ingenu is a 2.4GHz technology for M2M communications. It is primarily used in North America for the oil & gas industry, amongst others [@Ingenu2016]. It is equivalent to cellular standard but expensive.
* Weightless SIG reuses TV whitespace, and NB-IoT is actually formed off this protocol [@Weightless2015], [@Raza2017].
* NB-Fi Protocol is an open LPWAN protocol, which operates in unlicensed ISM radio band. Using the NB-Fi Protocol in devices ensures stable data transmission range of up to 10 km in dense urban conditions, and up to 30 km in rural areas with up to 10 years on battery power [@Ikpehai2018b].
* HaLow (pronounced halo) is a low-power, long-range version of the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. HaLow is based on the Wi-Fi Alliance 802.11ah specification and is expected to play an important part in IoT. At this stage it has low market traction.

### Unidirectional: LoRaWAN and SigFox {#unidirectional_lpwans}

<!-- #### LoRaWAN {#lorawan} -->

LoRa is a low-power wide-area network technology. It is based on spread spectrum modulation techniques derived from chirp spread spectrum technology. It was developed by Cycleo of Grenoble, France and acquired by Semtech the founding member of the LoRa Alliance. 

LoRaWAN is a contender for NB-IoT. It lacks bidirectionality and data rate.

* LoRaWAN performs better for short messages, but it is subjected to a very high penalty when
  more than one message per data block is required.
* Second, the LoRaWAN reliability mechanism must be ensured at the
  upper layers, and thus may incur higher energy costs.
* Lower (sub-500 devices per gateway) scalability of LoRaWAN per base station compared to NB-IoT and GPRS. This low scalability is due to the limited number of channels and the lack of any scheduling between devices. To compensate for the low scalability, an increase in spatially diverse base stations would allow packets to be received by multiple base stations at varying received power levels.

LoRaWAN uses chirp-spread-spectrum (CSS) and is publically accessible from networks such as The Things Network (TTN). Unfortunately, although that has the best coverage, it only uses class A which means it cannot listen for asynchronous downlink messages except after an uplink (which defeats the purpose of avoid unnecessary uplink transmissions which draw large current) [@Adelantado2017].

<!-- #### SigFox {#sigfox} -->

---

Sigfox is a French global network operator founded in 2009 that builds wireless networks to connect low-power objects such as electricity meters and smartwatches, which need to be continuously on and emitting small amounts of data. Sigfox is based in LabÃ¨ge near Toulouse, France, and has over 375 employees.

Briefly, SigFox is an ultra-narrow-band wireless technology that one can send 140 12-byte messages per day due to the duty cycle limitation of unlicensed frequencies. One can also receive 4 downlink ack messages, but this is not good enough when looking to optimize the sending of GPS/GNSS updates [@SigFox2016]. SigFox is a contender for NB-IoT, but it lacks bidirectionality and datarate.

Simulations show that with 55,000 devices transmitting the base station would reach the 270 simultaneously transmitting devices that Sigfox claims is possible while still ensuring a 99.9% PDR [@Thomas2018].

### Bidirectional: NB-IoT and Dash7 {#bidirectional_lpwans}

<!-- #### NB-IoT {#nbiot_lit} -->

Narrowband Internet of Things is a Low Power Wide Area Network radio technology standard developed by 3GPP to enable a wide range of cellular devices and services. The specification was frozen in 3GPP Release 13, in June 2016. Other 3GPP IoT technologies include eMTC and EC-GSM-IoT. 

NB-IoT is LTE's replacement for the power hungry GSM that some IoT devices still use. GSM is an aging technology which is being turned off in some parts of the world. It has 7 times better range and coverage, and power saving which can let a device last 10+ years on a single charge [@Wang2017c].

<!-- #### Dash7 {#dash7_lit} -->

---

DASH7 Alliance Protocol is an open source Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network protocol, which operates in the 433 MHz, 868 MHz and 915 MHz unlicensed ISM band/SRD band. 

* Bidirectional

Dash7 is a military RFID standard that has also grown into a medium range LPWAN [@noraird7].

Dash7 is considered a medium range LPWAN and is made for the full networking stack. It delivers an open standard for ultra low power mid-range sensor and actuator communication known as DASH7 Alliance Protocol (D7AP). D7AP is based on active RFID standards ISO 18000-7 for 433 MHz communication, however it has been significantly extended. It was originally intended by the US Department of Defense for container inventory and grew to become a medium range bidirectional wireless network system [@Weyn2015] useful in the indoor-outdoor realm. D7AP is modelled after a BLAST (Burst, Light, Asynchronous, Stealth, and Transitional) communication system which enables it to be a LPWAN competitor. D7AP is a full-stack protocol defining the complete OSI model, with support for three sub-GHz ISM bands, and three data rates (9.6 kbps, 55.55 kbps, and 166.67 kbps), as discussed above. D7AP uses 2-GFSK, the modulation schemes. D7AP can also re-use the PHY layer (radio frontend) of other LPWANs. Also, according to Cortus it should be possible to reuse the RF PHY layer (MSK downlink, OFDM uplink) of NB-IoT for Dash7's OSI stack, and in asset tracking, for example, it results in a compressed tracking solution that works well both indoors and outdoors. Dash7 claims 1m indoor accuracy by using vertex data from reference nodes for RSSI & RF fingerprinting.

Wizzilab is one of three main developers of Dash7. It offers the only full-kit open to development (at least in the form of an application processor). Haystack is another Dash7 developer with [https://github.com/jpnorair/OpenTag](https://github.com/jpnorair/OpenTag). Finally, the developer community with [https://github.com/MOSAIC-LoPoW/dash7-ap-open-source-stack](https://github.com/MOSAIC-LoPoW/dash7-ap-open-source-stack).

### LPWAN Comparison {#lpwan_comparison}

There are many wireless technologies out there, with some standardized, including but not limited to SigFox, LoRaWAN, Dash7, Bluetooth, 6LowPan, RPMA, Weightless, and IETF 6TiSCH. A brief comparison is drawn on NB-IoT against prominent unlicensed frequency LPWANs in Table \ref{tbl:lpwan_comparison}, and cellular LPWANs in Table \ref{tbl:cellular_comparison}.

[^ec_gsm_available]: eGPRS/EDGE-based EC-GSM-IoT is not available anywhere in the world yet.

To meet application specific requirements, the uniqueness of each technology gives each its advantages and disadvantages. Matching custom applications with a wireless technology is non-trivial as there is no silver bullet that matches all use-cases. In terms of a few metric capabilities, a best-and-worst case matrix is shown in Table \ref{tbl:lpwan_strengths}. NB-IoT is shown to be closest to being an all-round winner, with battery life the exception. This is another reason why battery life is investigated in this study.

Competition in the LPWAN space, regional momentum and IoT demand will ensure that the various technologies will continue to develop and improve to support more features and expand the network coverage.

Selected uptake of LPWANs is expected in specific use cases and results show that each technology is better suited to specific applications and their accompanying requirements. Sigfox, NB-IoT, and LoraWAN SF12 performed equally well for applications where MCL (range) is paramount, with LoraWAN SF7 doing slightly worse. In applications where the main consideration is scalability, Sigfox, and NB-IoT substantially outperformed the LoraWAN varieties. However, if battery life is the most important consideration, LoraWAN SF7 seems to have the edge, with NB-IoT performing worse. NB-IoT performed the best for uplink throughput, with LoraWAN SF7 coming in second. For the downlink throughput and firmware upgradability metric, NB-IoT performs substantially better than the other technologies. All in all, NB-IoT outperforms SigFox and LoRaWAN in UL/DL throughput, scalability, MCL range and FoTA updates. It is superseded by LoRaWAN in battery life for SF7. If NB-IoT worked with the mobile network operators to reduce its RRC-idle phase, it could develop a minimal power consumption to compare with that of LoRaWAN and Sigfox [@Thomas2018]. By finding ways to increase battery life, it may just be the 'silver bullet' for all IoT use cases.

In places requiring deep indoor penetration with 30 dBm path loss, NB-IoT performs well with 8\% outage, while SigFox, LoRaWAN, GPRS are unable to cover 13\%, 20\% and 60\% of locations, respectively, in a 7800 km\textsuperscript{2} area simulated by Lauridsen [@Lauridsen2017].

NB-IoT's mean energy values are similar to LoRaWAN devices transmitting in SF12 configuration. However, best case results (in 5th percentile) are comparable to LoRaWAN in SF8. NB-IoT has peak transmission at 220 mA, whilst LoRaWAN at 40 mA [@Martinez2019]. Although LoRaWAN has the predictable chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulated signal, NB-IoT only uses this peak power in it's initial physical random access channel (PRACH) [@Thomas2018]. This shows that with further investigation into the variation, NB-IoT can certainly be on par with LoRaWAN in terms of energy consumption. Nevertheless, NB-IoT does guarantee packet delivery if within range while LoRaWAN has a variable packet delivery ratio (PDR). The expected achievable lifespan (on average) for a NB-IoT is on the order 2-3 years, depending on the datagram size. Nevertheless, sending larger messages (up to 512 bytes) has almost no impact on NB-IoT. Simple periodic-reporting applications can model the average power approximately by Eq. \ref{eq:avgpower}:

$$P = \frac{E_{msg}}{T_{msg}}$$ {#eq:avgpower}

From Durand's results it is clear that LoRaWAN SF7 is the most power-efficient, due to the short transmission burst. NB-IoT displays the worst power-consumption, due to the extended RRC-idle state [@Thomas2018]. This can be reduced using Release Assistance as in \S\ref{release_a}.

If downlink latency is a critical component without battery life constraints, GPRS would be better suited as it requires constant signaling between BTS and UE device. Otherwise, applications requiring bidirectional communications of more than 120 bytes per day should use GPRS or NB-IoT, as LoRaWAN and SigFox are limited by duty-cycle since they use unlicensed frequencies. In deep coverage situations, SigFox and NB-IoT is recommended as it offers an MCL of more than 158 dBm [@Thomas2018]. In South Africa, GPRS and SigFox have similar levels of coverage, and the choice in wireless technology depends on data throughput. Low bandwidth wireless technologies typically have more range than their high data throughput counterparts. That's why SigFox requires few sites to cover vast areas, compared to GPRS or LTE networks. NB-IoT should be similar to SigFox in this regard, as they share similar MCLs.

For IoT devices used in extended coverage situations, such as deep-indoor devices or remote locations, we recommend either Sigfox or NB-IoT, as they offer a maximum MCL of more than 158 dB. IoT devices for general use would benefit from the large-scale deployment of the GPRS network, which provides excellent coverage because of its legacy infrastructure. It is clear that the extra overhead available in Sigfox, LoRaWAN, and NB-IoT allows for better indoor coverage than GPRS, which means that the LPWAN devices can be used in less than optimal operating conditions. Measured MCL correlates with theoretical values.

In terms of throughput, it's important to note that unlicensed spectrum LPWANs such as SigFox and LoRaWAN are heavily duty cycled, unlike cellular technologies such as NB-IoT or GPRS.


## Use Cases {#usecases}

IoT has use case requirements in uplink and downlink transmission, throughput, battery longevity and scalability. Two types of use cases are looked at here for their unidirectional and bidirectional behaviors, namely smart metering and actuator control, and a novel way of using downlink control in asset tracking is presented before a list of use cases.

### Smart Metering {#smartmetering}

One of the simplest and most popular use cases in IoT is smart metering. Periodically sending uplink data at regular intervals from a static location has the advantage of remote monitoring and reducing the need for physical readings. It also opened up new features for users (such as dynamic pricing and usage pattern analysis) and operators (such as load balancing a large number of clients). The clear value proposition and success is partially due to the belief that IoT should be low powered and low data transmissions which still exists today and has made it the traditional IoT model.

Smart metering can be easily applied to most LPWANs, but only a few have synchronous downlink capabilities, and NB-IoT can be considered well suited for bidirectional uses cases such as actuator control.

### Actuator Control

An *actuator* is a component of a machine that is responsible for moving and *controlling* a mechanism or system, for example by opening a valve. In this use case, actuator control requires bidirectionality for its downlink controllability. Suprisingly, this bidirectionality can be applied to many fields as in Table \ref{tbl:use_cases_list}.

### Asset tracking {#asset_tracking}

Many use cases in the Internet of Things (IoT) require or benefit from location information, making positioning a vital dimension in the IoT. The 3GPP has dedicated a significant effort during its Release 14 to enhance positioning support for its IoT technologies. There are still design challenges with regard to positioning support in LTE-M and NB-IoT that need to be taken into consideration. Nevertheless, the 3GPP is working on enhancing position support such as OTDOA, which is a downlink based positioning method. The OTDOA positioning reference signals can also be simulated to illustrate the positioning performance [@Lin2017],[@Miao2018].

TDoA, ToF, Aoa, RSSI, are all land-based techniques for pinpointing the location of an endpoint. They require real-time clocks accurate to the millionth of a second as well as expensive gateway hardware. Depending on the frequencies, wireless network and modulation, one can get different ranges. This is useful for the indoors. Unfortunately, range is sacrificed for accuracy.

Satellites, on the other hand are in stable LEO or geostationary orbits and a constellation of satellites can keep in constant synchronization using atom clocks . One retains accuracy, even over long distances due to the ultra high precision of the clocks. This is useful for the outdoors.

Besides having the ability to measure RSSI which seems quite standard in wireless networks, NB-IoT is also lucky to have the benefits re-using the Timing-Advance (TDoA) hardware when upgrading cellphone towers with the capability. This means that one can reasonably approximate the position of an endpoint to within a 1000m.

Consider a unidirectional wireless network that, although it has many kilometers of range, has limited capability in receiving downlink messages from gateways. Adding a GPS/GNSS module is increasingly trivial and inexpensive these days [@Allan2013], although one still has to deal with the occasional cold start and periodic receive windows to determine the whereabouts of the device in question [@Bulusu2000]. To avoid using the receive windows unless necessary, one can easily know when a device is static by observing movement via an accelerometer or similar [@Bujari2012], but purposefully locomotive devices require more computationally expensive means such as dead reckoning to determine if the endpoint has moved significantly to require another GPS/GNSS location update [@Goyal2011]. 

One of the benefits of bidirectional LPWANs over satellite localization is the fact that towers have the capability of beaconing a positioning reference signal [@Lin2017]. A more effective alternative to determining location besides satellite localization can be periodically observing the receive signal strength indicator (RSSI) for changes which directly translate to movement in meters which warrant a GPS/GNSS location update. RSSI has been used in fingerprinting localization for GSM-based devices [@Ibrahim2012]. Listening for a terrestrial tower certainly doesn't require a lower receive sensitivity than for a satellite a few hundred kilometers in the sky, and with a much higher throughput than the typical 50 bit/s of GPS/GNSS. GPS/GNSS signals can also be relayed indoors using an outdoor and indoor antenna [@Haddrell2001].

Durand [@Thomas2018] suggests NB-IoT is poor for asset tracking and utility metering due to its high energy transmissions. By using the push-pull model as in \ref{pushpull} and only pulling data when a device's data/location is desired or pushing data when out of a geofence, one can save energy so much so that it can be considered better than LoRaWAN or SigFox, even though they may use less energy per transmission.


## A Deeper Look into NB-IoT {#nbiot}

This section describes NB-IoT in more detail and the setup procedures involved.

### Development and Present Standing {#lit_standing}

Formed by the 3GPP from LTE, NB-IoT was developed within that framework and its capabilities are particularly well suited to smart metering.

Compared to LTE, NB-IoT devices are usually stationary with intermittent burst transmissions, low data bandwidth, delay-tolerant applications, support for huge number of devices, dealing with poor coverage (indoor penetration) and having a battery lifetime of at least a few years.

Taking it one step further, the 3GPP defined two device categories, namely Cat NB1 and NB2, with the latter adding support for:

- Device positioning/location using OTDOA
- Seamless intra-and-inter-cellular cell-reselection for improved mobility.
- Push-to-talk voice messaging
- Multicast transmission to multiple devices simultaneously.

NB-IoT devices are seen as stationary, only small chunks of data are intermittently transmitted and applications are envisaged as delay-tolerant. NB-IoT technology is designed such that it can be used in areas beyond the radio coverage of current cellular standards and in devices which must run from battery power for many years. The devices will generally send small amounts of data infrequently; a typical usage scenario might be 100 to 200 bytes sent twice per day for battery powered devices. For mains powered devices the limit is not based on battery size, but cost and network bandwidth/resources.

![IoT Wireless Technology Representation [@Martinez2019] \label{fig:nbiot_positioning}](../images/1559246290186.png){width=85%}

The system operation is analogous to SMS in that it is a datagram-oriented, stored-and-forward
system, rather than a GPRS-like IP pipe. This is because NB-IoT devices spend most of their time
asleep, making possible the required long battery life. The system implements extended DRX cycles
for paging, but as this window will be limited to save battery life, the delivery of downlink messages
occurs mainly when the system detects that uplink messages have been received from a device
(indicating that it is awake). Here a store-and-forward system, an âIoT Platformâ, is useful.

NB-IoT has a certain standing in IoT and LPWANs, and this can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:nbiot_positioning}. It would be on a par with LPWANs except for variable energy consumption.

Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) include SigFox, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Dash7, Weightless, N-Wave, NB-Fi, Thread and others. Some of these, like SigFox and LoRaWAN are unidirectional, which make them unsuitable for critical applications which require downlink acknowledgement or more. These have ranges from 2 - 20 km and can be considered outdoor technologies along with cellular IoT [@Ikpehai2018b].

Low Power Local Area Networks (LPLANs) include BLE, 6LoPAN, Thread, ZigBee, WiFi and others. 
Unfortunately, due to country regulations the output power is limited especially for unlicensed frequencies. They may not even be suited for long range on the PHY layer, but they can essentially be considered indoor technologies with ranges of 10-100m [@Lee2007].

Cellular-IoT includes LTE Cat-M, LTE Cat-NB or NB-IoT and EC-GSM-IoT. GSM has high battery usage due to constant synchronization in active mode, and un-optimized transmission of data. It is generally not considered in this thesis because it is a sunsetting technology. LTE-M is also considered a high-power technology and is not as suited for IoT as NB-IoT is [@EricssonAB2016a], although there is evidence that it is quite similar [@realDiffs2016].  Maximum coupling loss (MCL), discussed more in \S\ref{lit_mcl}, is defined in different scenarios (3GPP 36.888, RP-150492 and 45.820 7A) giving NB-IoT a significant 8 dBm edge over LTE Cat-M, at 164 dBm. By using the same  assumptions, LTE Cat-M actually performs slightly better. In terms of power, LTE Cat-M uses 50% less power, except for deep penetration cases where NB-IoT's uplink fares better (LTE Cat-M will match this in Release 14). Finally, in terms of cost, NB-IoT is only marginally cheaper than LTE Cat-M by < 2\% [@realDiffs2016].

Martinez [@Martinez2019] has explored NB-IoT from the perspective of the application developer. When evaluating performance, it would do well to find the limits of the technology as well as find the optimum 'sweet spot' or range for efficient operation. This decent study on the operational trade-offs of NB-IoT over LTE proves NB-IoT to be competitive in terms of energy consumption amongst other LPWANs. Although there are many complexities such as signalling, dynamic adjustments triggered by network conditions and  timings, its competitive energy consumption is due to 3GPP efforts to match LPWANs. By using proprietary spectrum over unlicensed ISM bands, NB-IoT avoids external interference and mandatory duty cycling. Even though employing increased repeatability due to the ECL mechanism increases unpredictability in device behavior, it ensures reliability by guaranteeing delivery unless outside the maximum range or signal strength bounds that a device can communicate with a tower. This variability in delivery time can be a deal-breaker for some critical applications, but on the whole it is suitable for delay-tolerant applications, and under 10 seconds will cater for most use cases. The ownership model is a connectivity service or contract, and is charged per byte. Coverage depends on deployed infrastructure.

A user would consider critical characteristics such as energy consumption, coverage, cost, network latency and behavior. Martinez looks at these except for cost, which is better looked at by Ali [@Ali2015]. A set of tests were devised and results showed that in some cases its energy consumption performed better than an LPWAN referenced technology such as LoRa, with the added benefit of guaranteeing delivery. However, the high variability in energy consumption and network latency call into question its reliability especially for mission-critical applications.

In future NB-IoT will have the capability of D2D communications as outlined in 3GPP future release specifications.

\hypertarget{lte-architecture}{%
\subsubsection[LTE Architecture and SIBs]{LTE Architecture}\label{lte-architecture}}

<!--### LTE Architecture-->

Although most users interact only with the UE device which runs its own proprietary firmware stack, NB-IoT also has a complex backend architecture.

![LTE classic architecture](../images/LTE_classic_architecture.png)

The complexities of LTE architecture further increases the chance of performance degradation with respect to 3GPP specifications due to the vast array of setup parameters. It would be beneficial to analyze the performance of multiple UE devices against various MNO vendors. It is important to note that MNOs may use various vendors in their architecture, and thus this study is mainly focused on the eNodeB vendor which is also UE device facing and has the greatest chance of performance degradation due network quality, RF interference and so forth.

#### System Information Blocks (SIBs) {#sib}

System Information Blocks define configurations for UE device to follow, such as the method of attachment and number of transmission repetitions. Once an RRC connection is made, the eNodeB uses the perceived SNR to allocate uplink throughput the UE device can use to transmit messages. Because of dynamic allocation, predicting power consumption of a single message in the field is difficult. Example SIBs can be found in Appendix \ref{appendix_sibs}. The most important one is known as the Master Information Block (MIB).

Since UE devices must follow NW settings broadcast inside the SIB, the UE device is to a large extent controlled by the network/eNodeB.

### UE Device Hardware {#lit_hardware}

This subsection looks at hardware specific to the UE device.

![Examples of different NB-IoT UE modems with A) Ublox Sara N200, B) Quectel BC95, C) Nordic nRF9160, D) SimCom 7020E](../images/ue_hardware.png){width=45%}

[](../images/image-20191105225743913.png)

![Current usage decreases depending on eDRX power saving configuration. In this case, it is the SimCom 7020E modem.](../images/image-20191106012315421.png){width=60%}

![Current usage across different LTE bands \label{fig:current_band}](../images/image-20191106005828336.png){width=100%}

![Current versus transmit power for NB-IoT modems \label{fig:current_txpower}](../images/image-20191106012023102.png)

As seen in Figure \ref{fig:current_band}, \ref{fig:current_txpower}, Ublox and Quectel share similar traits, unlike Nordic and SimCom. Since Ublox and Quectel share similar traits, it is suitable for a comparison of LTE vendors.

### Network Registration, RRC Connection and Inactivity Timer {#rrc_inactivity}

By default, NB-IoT modules usually try to register with the network defined by the current SIM card in the UE device at the time, and use the default APN from the network. During the registration process, an RRC connection is made to the base station. If the IMEI and IMSI of the module is not allowed on the network, the module will disconnect. This can be seen after the "1" then "0" response of the `+CSCON` AT command URC (provides signalling connection status) without `+CEREG` (network registration status) showing a "1" (registered) or "5" (registered and roaming), which means the module was not able to register on the network. It will also contain an EMM reject cause value, with more information in 3GPP TS 24.301. See [@ubloxAppNote2018] for a connection status compatibility matrix.

At the first registration or when the module wakes from the power save mode (PSM), it performs a
Random Access CHannel (RACH) procedure to attach to the base station. This establishes a Radio
Resource Control (RRC) connection to the base station. Once established only the base station can
release this connection. The module cannot drop the RRC connection other than turning off the
radio using the AT+CFUN=0 command.

After network registration or transmission of a data packet, the device usually enters RRC connected (C-DRX) for a network-specified `inactivity timeout` and receives all the base station (BTS) signalling. Sending and receiving messages in this mode is immediate, otherwise with no activity average power is typically ~50mA. If the RRC connection is left for 20 s of inactivity before the RRC is released, then this will consume about 1 mWh @ 3.6V. At the end of this period, if no messages are being transmitted from the module, the +CSCON response will be â0â to show the RRC connection has been released by the eNodeB.

\hypertarget{power-saving-mechanisms}{%
\subsubsection[Power-Saving Mechanisms: T3324 Active, T3412 PTAU, eDRX,PTW, Release-A]{Power-Saving Mechanisms}\label{power-saving-mechanisms}}  

<!--### Power-Saving Mechanisms: T3324 Active, T3412 PTAU, eDRX, PTW, Release-A-->

NB-IoT allows for various power saving mechanisms design to prolong the lifetime of battery-powered devices. Except for release assistance, the module automatically enters the different states depending on defined configuration. Release assistance, as explained in \S\ref{release_a}, terminates the network defined `inactivty timer` such that it enters into the states shown in Fig. \ref{fig:power_saving_mechanisms}.

![Power Saving Mechanisms \label{fig:power_saving_mechanisms}](C:\Users\d7rob\AppData\Roaming\Typora\typora-user-images\1555540836196.png){width=80%}

It is recommended to order the network configuration values of the following from smallest to largest for proper operation:

1. Paging Time Window (PTW)
2. eDRX cycle value
3. T3324 Active Timer
4. T3412 PTAU Timer

#### T3412 PTAU Timer {#lit_ptau}

During the RRC-connected phase (C-DRX), the eNodeB knows exactly in which cell/sector/antenna the UE device is on a relatively precise level. Outside of this it assigns a tracking area code (TAC) and broadcasts to all UEs in the area with the aim to wake it up if there is an incoming message. This is especially useful if the devices is semi-mobile and moves to a different area. The periodic tracking area update timer (PTAU) updates the network and UE devices with the tracking area that the residing device is currently connected at the end of the power saving mode (PSM) as in fig. \ref{fig:power_saving_mechanisms}.

Timers can be configured using AT commands.

Table: Configuring the T3412 PTAU Timer. Bits 5 to 1 represent the binary coded timer value. Bits 6 to 8 define the timer value unit for the PTAU timer as follows. See more in 3GPP TS 24.008 [4], figure 10.5.147a and table 10.5.163a. {#tbl:ptau} 

| 8 7 6 | Description                                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0 0 0 | value is incremented in multiples of 10 minutes         |
| 0 0 1 | value is incremented in multiples of 1 hour             |
| 0 1 0 | value is incremented in multiples of 10 hours           |
| 0 1 1 | value is incremented in multiples of 2 seconds          |
| 1 0 0 | value is incremented in multiples of 30 seconds         |
| 1 0 1 | value is incremented in multiples of 1 minute           |
| 1 1 0 | value is incremented in multiples of 320 hours[^NOTE_1] |
| 1 1 1 | value indicates that the timer is deactivated[^NOTE_2]  |

* Example: "000 00111" = 7 x 10 minutes = 70 minutes

[^NOTE_1]: This timer value unit is only applicable to the T3312 and T3412 extended value (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [5]). If received in an integrity protected message, the value shall be interpreted as multiples of 320 hours, otherwise 1 hour.
[^NOTE_2]: This timer value unit is not applicable to the T3412 extended value. If received, the T3412 extended value shall be considered as not included in the message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [5]).

#### T3324 Active Timer

The T3324 Active Timer controls the time period during which the UE device can be paged by the network in RRC Idle, and the number of eDRX cycles. The inactivity and active timer is reset after a downlink message is received. Fragmented downlink data has a negative impact on energy savings which should be taken into account.

Table: Configuring the T3324 Active Timer. Bits 5 to 1 represent the binary coded timer value. Bits 6 to 8 define the timer value unit for the Active timer as follows. See more in 3GPP TS 24.008 [4], figure 10.5.147a and table 10.5.163a. {#tbl:active}

| 8 7 6 | Description                                     |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 0 0 0 | value is incremented in multiples of 2 seconds  |
| 0 0 1 | value is incremented in multiples of 1 minute   |
| 0 1 0 | value is incremented in multiples of deci-hours |
| 1 1 1 | value indicates that the timer is deactivated   |

* Example: "001 00101" = 5 x 1 minute = 5 minutes

#### eDRX Cycles and PTW {#lit_edrx_ptw}

Extended Discontinuous Reception (eDRX) mode means that paging windows can be scheduled such that the modem can be contacted by the server. A single eDRX cycle is composed of an active phase, controlled by a Paging Time Window (PTW) timer, followed by a sleep phase until the end of the eDRX cycle. Within the PTW, the standard LTE paging is observed. DRX intervals are network controlled, and are usually set to every 1.28, 2.56, 5.12 or 10.24 seconds. Paging Time Windows (PTW), ranging from 2.56 s to 40.96 s, control the number of DRX intervals followed by a sleep phase until the end of the eDRX cycle, ranging from 10.24 seconds to 2621.44 seconds (43.69 minutes).

#### Release Assistance {#release_a}

Release assistance requests the eNodeB to release the RRC connection immediately. By avoiding 20 seconds of idle RRC in C-DRX mode, there is a 93% improvement in power consumption for a 200 byte transmission in ECL 1 [@ubloxAppNote2018]. This can also be done for data  transmissions by sending a flag with the data packet. This flag is noticed by the MME on the network and the eNodeB releases the connection immediately thereafter. It remains within T3324 Active Time for a period of time where the eNodeB could be paging the device in eDRX intervals before going into deep sleep mode until the T3412 PTAU Timer expires. Unfortunately there is no support for release assistance for downlink data.

### Repetitions and Enhanced Coverage Levels {#ECLs}

Enhanced Coverage Levels determine the number of repetitions in the uplink channel. Coverage levels range from 0 for normal operation and 2 for the worst case scenario, and repetitions range from 2 to 128. Although the network determines the ECL for the UE device, it is factors such as RF network conditions interference that influence the number of repetitions. Network operators should provide enough coverage to allow devices to be mostly in coverage class 0 or 1. Depending on the NB-IoT deployment, the network could have large areas, or devices located in deep locations which unfortunately mean they operate in Coverage Class 2. It would be best to minimize ECL 2 except for deep indoor penetration use cases due to the high energy usage since it uses high repetitions for the RACH process and also higher coding schemes when transmitting data.

An example of sending a 200 byte message in ECL 2 with good SNR can include 5 RACH transmission bursts, a Transmission Block Size ~43 bytes, one repetition and taking just over 1 second, consuming 200uWh. For the same example in bad SNR, the TBS allocated 32 bytes per chunk, with a repetition of 8 and 4. It took 5.5 seconds and consumed 1.07mWh -- fives times as much as before.

### RF Characteristics, MCL and monitoring network behavior {#rf_characteristics}

When only a fraction of the existing LTE cell sites support NB-IoT, devices cannot attach to the best cell if that cell does not support NB-IoT. As a result, the path loss can be very high. In addition, they also suffer from high interference from non-NB-IoT cells [@Mangalvedhe2016a].

In the uplink, there are two physical layer channels. The random access channel connects to the base station and the uplink channel contains the data and control information. In downlink there are four channels. Synchronization is used by the endpoint to estimate symbol timing and carrier frequency and obtain the cell identity and frame boundary. The broadcast channel contains the master information block (MIB). The control channel carries downlink control information and can be repeated 2048 times, as well as the data channel which contains the payload, paging, system information and the random access response. [@Adhikary2016].

NB-IoT operation requires a minimum bandwidth of 180 kHz, which is equal to the size of the smallest LTE Physical Resource Block (PRB). Depending on the availability of spectrum, NB-IoT can be either deployed on its own (âstandalone operationâ), in the guard carriers of existing LTE/UMTS spectrum (âguardband operationâ) or within an existing LTE carrier by replacing one or more PRBs (âinband operationâ). In order to support such flexible deployment scenarios, NB- IoT reuses the LTE design extensively, such as the OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) type of modulation in downlink, SC-FDMA (Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access) in uplink, channel coding, rate matching and interleaving. In addition, a host of new features are added to ensure the demands of IoT based applications. Key design changes from LTE include the synchronization sequences, the random access preamble, the broadcast channel and the control channel. These changes are primarily motivated by the fact that NB-IoT is required to operate on a minimum bandwidth of 180 kHz (1 PRB), whereas many channels in LTE were designed to span multiple PRBs occupying greater bandwidth compared to 180 kHz. These design changes achieve the IoT requirements while ensuring best co-existence performance with the existing LTE system [@Adhikary2016].

#### MCL {#lit_mcl}

Maximum coupling loss (MCL) is defined as the maximal total channel loss between User Equipment (UE) and eNodeB (eNB) antenna ports at which the data service can still be delivered. Practically, it includes antenna gains, path loss, shadowing and any other impairments. The higher the MCL, the more robust the link is. 

#### UE Device and Network Behavior

Users can monitor the status of the moduleâs connection, registration and PSM state by
polling or configuring URCs. By monitoring the module status, it can behave more efficiently for various applications. The `+CEREG` AT command can be used to check the network registration status, including registered, not registered, in the process of registering, denied registration, unknown and roaming. During this process, when the module is searching for a network, the `+NUESTATS` AT command can be polled to view receive and transmit time-on-air. Increasing receive time means the module scanning for a base station, and increase transmit time indicates an attempt to register with a base station. If the Total Power (RSSI) and Signal Power (RSRP) values are different than -32767 (invalid) then the module has
read the MIB and SIB signals from the base station. With the `+CSCON` URC enabled to indicate each RRC connection change, it will show a "1" when connected and "0" when not.

International SIMs (roaming SIM) can make the registration process take many minutes for the first time. Once registered, the network PLMN should be stored in the SIM for faster registration next time.

The `+NUESTATS` AT command provides many other details, such as RF radio, network, throughput and data size characteristics.

Registration EMM reject cause values, as mentioned in \S\ref{rrc_inactivity}, are described in the 3GPP TS 24.008 [4] with typical causes including:

* #5 IMEI not accepted
* #11 PLMN not allowed
* #12 Location Area not allowed
* #13 Roaming not allowed in this location area
* #22 Congestion

Unsolicited result codes (URCs) are asynchronous messages output by the UE device to inform at any time of specific events or status changes such as the following in Table \ref{tbl:URCs}.

Table: Useful URCs for Ublox, Quectel {#tbl:URCs}

| URCs       | Description                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- |
| AT+CMEE=2  | Error result code            |
| AT+NPSMR=1 | Power saving mode changes    |
| AT+CSCON=1 | RRC connected changes        |
| AT+CEREG=5 | Network registration changes |

In the setup stage, it is important to use `AT+NCONFIG="CR_0859_SI_AVOID","TRUE"` and \newline`AT+NCONFIG="CR_0354_0338_SCRAMBLING","TRUE"` in South Africa as this is not documented in the application manual [@ubloxAppNote2018].

When it comes to base stations, the user does not have control over the inactivity timer. Release assistance can request the eNB/network to disconnect the modem from Radio Resource Control (RRC) connected mode.

When the module is synchronized to the base station, the +NUESTATS AT command is able to describe the radio, cell, BLER, throughput statistics and other signaling info received. The most useful statistic is the "RADIO" type.

Manufacturers usually provide application examples useful to test each command in development [@ubloxAppNote2018].

#### Application Architecture

![Typical application example \textcopyright{Ublox} \label{fig:app_ex_ublox}](../images/1569744612309.png)

Users of NB-IoT modules include customers in industry, government enterprise and consumers and in essence they have the simple goal of reaching the internet. In Fig. \ref{fig:app_ex_ublox}, a typical customer's device communicates with a cell tower that supports NB-IoT. From there it propagates through the LTE infrastructure of the cellular network before it reaches the internet, usually in the form of an IoT platform and the customer's server. NB-IoT modules offer a few IoT layers to communicate, from simple UDP, TCP sockets to MQTT and CoAP messaging. Developers with a GPRS type background may expect a session-oriented always-on connection, however, NB-IoT has higher latencies which need to be considered, especially when setting up eDRX and PSM modes for the extended battery life lasting up to many years. 

UDP sockets are connection-less, and packets may be lost. If the application doesn't provide its own acknowledgements, CoAP does take this into account when used over UDP.

For devices that stay dormant for long periods of time, the server will know when they are active when devices send an outbound message. It will be in RRC-connected mode until the inactivity timer expires, and it can still be paged within the T3324 Active period, so servers should respond timeously.

Martinez et al. [@Martinez2019] did empirical tests within the Vodafone Network in Barcelona. They observed UE device and NW behavior, measured current traces, and did various tests in different modes. Martinez suggested the following modes in Table \ref{tbl:nw_config}.

Table: Suggested application power saving modes [@Martinez2019]. It should be noted that the network default for the Inactivity timer remains when registering and on downlink messages. {#tbl:nw_config}

| Mode       | NW Configuration                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mode 1** | Inactivity timer = 20s (network default)\newline T3324 = 0s (disabled)\newline C-DRX = 2.048s (network default) |
| **Mode 2** | Inactivity timer = Immediate Release\newline T3324 = 8s\newline I-DRX = 2.56s\newline eDRX/PTW = Disabled |
| **Mode 3** | Inactivity timer = Immediate Release\newline T3324 = 0s (disabled) |

With AT commands, UE devices can be controlled to an extent on the client-side except for LTE network-side settings, transmit power and message latency. This loss of control comes at the cost of energy consumption, yet guarantee of message acknowledgement. Luckily, server-side applications can be aware of devices too and send updated configurations and firmware-over-the-air (FoTA) updates for adaptability to devices due to their bidirectionality.

## Summary

With a deeper understanding of NB-IoT in this chapter, we can see how it exhibits variable characteristics as opposed to what theoretical analysis or simulations can provide due to the complexities of the underlying legacy LTE architecture and most notably in the energy consumption of datagram packets, besides other metrics. NB-IoT has a strong footprint in IoT due to its low-power bidirectionality which gives it an edge over other LPWANs, and this enables a broad variety of use cases. Since we can now better understand the different facets of NB-IoT, related concepts and literature as stated above, we can further investigate the change in variability across different UE devices and LTE vendors in Chapter \ref{design}.
