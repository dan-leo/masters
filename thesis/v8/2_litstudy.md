# Literature Study CH2 {#litstudy}

Considering current literature, several studies provide theoretical models not only for the energy consumption of NB-IoT networks [@Andres-Maldonado2017], but also for their latency and delay bounds [@Feltrin2019], impact of coverage extensions [@Andres-Maldonado2018b], coverage performance [@Adhikary2016], battery lifetimes [@Yeoh2018d],[@Lauridsen2018], theoretically optimal configuration strategies [@Feltrin2018] and overall performance for particular verticals [@Soussi2018],[@Beyene2017b].

Only Martinez [@Martinez2019] focuses effort on the adopter and presents an operational and empirical analysis of the technology when it is deployed in a real network (such as Vodafone in the Metropolitan area of Barcelona). Durand [@Thomas2018] compares different LPWANs empirically including NB-IoT. Despite the unquestionable value of the theoretical models (for example, to understand orders of magnitude or to guess the theoretical upper and lower bounds), an empirical approach provides real insights into the variability that a UE device experiences when deployed in real conditions. This work therefore complements Martinez and related works, and it further provides empirical measurements for UEs that are deployed using a real-world NB-IoT network always while taking the perspective of an application developer.

* GSM RF equipment testing and performance analysis [@Kasbah2005]
* Analysis of NB-IoT Deployment in LTE Guard-Band [@Ratasuk2017c]

Whilst this research is funded by MTN and being aware of internal documentation, this is an independent study which should aid any potential adopters of the technology.

The empirical results of NB-IoT depend on the device used (UE) and underlying LTE vendor architecture of the MNO providing coverage. Thus, 


## Internet of Things{#iot}

The internet of things has surged in popularity over recent years as an interconnected system of devices that transfer data over a network without requiring human interaction.

Looking at Gartner's analysis of technology expectations with regards to NB-IoT and related technologies, in 2014 Gartner estimated that Internet of Things (IoT) had reached the height of inflated expectations, and the hype it generated lives on in a rich ecosystem of emerging technologies. As of July 2018, NB-IoT and IoT has falling interest (and hype) in Fig. \ref{fig:gartner_ictAfrica}, yet it will reach productivity in 2-10 years time. Since new coverage has not been rolled out for almost two years to date, we believe there is a strong chance for renewed NB-IoT interest in Africa.

[](../images/hype-cycle-2014-100371840-large.idge.jpeg)

![[Gartner's 2018 Hype Cycle for ICT in Africa. NB-IoT is high on the list of expectations. \label{fig:gartner_ictAfrica}](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3884512)](../images/42881085945_739bbdc8e9_c.jpg){ width=90% }

As of August 2019, Gartner has high expectations for 5G and other emerging technologies which can make use of what [IoT has to offer](https://blogs.sas.com/content/hiddeninsights/2016/07/06/long-live-the-iot-hype/). This can be seen in Fig. \ref{fig:gartner_emergingTech}.

![Gartner's Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2019. IoT is inextricably linked to at least a third of emerging technologies and also has uses in NB-IoT. \label{fig:gartner_emergingTech}](../images/CTMKT_741609_CTMKT_for_Emerging_Tech_Hype_Cycle_LargerText-1.png){ width=90% }

On the other hand, this does not slow the growth in number of devices connected as in Fig. \ref{fig:iot_growth}. IoT merely manifests itself in other uses and forms such as we have already seen in Fig. \ref{fig:gartner_emergingTech}. NB-IoT can be integral to aid this growth.

![Exponential growth of IoT is estimated [@Ali2015]. \label{fig:iot_growth}](../images/Expected-number-of-connected-devices-to-the-Internet-This-chart-is-obtained-from-recent.png){ width=80% }

Matching emerging applications with existing technologies has become one of the
main challenges for IoT initiatives, especially when a new technology appears in the landscape and the map must be redrawn. Massive IoT is the deployment of an immense number of low-powered devices with infrequent reporting and both NB-IoT and LTE Cat-M fulfill the requirements of 5G massive MTC/IoT.

### Push-Pull Model

Traditionally, IoT devices push data to the internet at regular intervals. This push model can be considered quite energy inefficient, especially when the data is only occasionally actionable. For example, in asset tracking or remote monitoring.

A pull model is ideal for dynamic rule engines, pulling data only when necessary and ultimately edge computing, where building an application around this idea can greatly enhance battery life.

### Edge Computing

Edge computing is the practice of offloading cloud processes to the endpoint. It saves on data overhead, especially when there are data charges involved and battery longevity is desired.

Since NB-IoT is optimized for downlink communications, it can be the ideal candidate.

### Satellite IoT

Compared to LPWANs, Satellite IoT has global coverage. In terms of packet payload size, a typical system such as the Iridium 9602/9603 will transmit up to 270 bytes or receive 340 bytes via AT commands. A supercapacitor is necessary for the initial 7.5W burst for 10ms which opens a session, and with an open sky messages can be sent every 10 seconds. It even features a 'Ring Alert' feature, similar to eDRX in NB-IoT in that modems listen for when incoming messages are available, for satellites to page a modem when a mobile terminated (MT) message is available from an internet-facing endpoint. Although Ring Alerts are sent to the position of the last known transmission, an Iridium satellite spot beam is about 400km in diameter meaning devices would have to travel quite far before requiring a simple re-registration transmission. The greatest drawback is the upfront, rental and per byte costs looking at \pounds159, \pounds12/month and \pounds0.14 per 50 byte credit respectively on Rock Seven Mobile Services Ltd, and the high power draw compared to NB-IoT.

## Low-Powered Wide-Area Networks {#lpwans}

There are many wireless technologies out there, with some standardized, including but not limited to SigFox, LoRaWAN, Dash7, Bluetooth, 6LowPan, RPMA, Weightless, and IETF 6TiSCH. A brief comparison is drawn on NB-IoT against prominent unlicensed frequency LPWANs in Table \ref{tbl:lpwan_comparison}, and cellular LPWANs in Table \ref{tbl:cellular_comparison}.

[^ec_gsm_available]: eGPRS/EDGE-based EC-GSM-IoT is not available anywhere in the world yet.

To meet application specific requirements, the uniqueness of each technology gives each its advantages and disadvantages. Matching custom applications with a wireless technology is non-trivial as there is no silver bullet that matches all use-cases. In terms of a few metric capabilities, a best-and-worst case matrix is shown in Table \ref{tbl:lpwan_strengths}. NB-IoT is shown to be closest to being an all-round winner, with battery life the exception. This is another reason why battery life is investigated in this study.

* Competition in the LPWAN space and regional momentum will ensure that the various technologies will continue to develop and improve to support more features and expand the network coverage. 
* 
* Poor for asset tracking and utility metering.
* Average for smart bicyles, parking, garbage bins, agriculture and intelligent buildings.
* Good for pet tracking, POS, healthcare.
* NB-IoT outperforms SigFox and LoRaWAN in UL/DL throughput, scalability, MCL range and FoTA updates. It is superseded by LoRaWAN in battery life for SF7.
* If NB-IoT worked with the mobile network operators to reduce its RRC-idle phase, it could develop a minimal power consumption to compare with that of LoRaWAN and Sigfox.

Although there are many ways to connect IoT to the internet, NB-IoT is an LPWAN which is the focus of this study.

### LoRaWAN {#lorawan}

LoRaWAN is a contender for NB-IoT. It lacks bidirectionality and data rate.

* LoRaWAN performs better for short messages, but it is subjected to a very high penalty when
  more than one message per data block is required.
* Second, the LoRaWAN reliability mechanism must be ensured at the
  upper layers, and thus may incur higher energy costs.

### Dash7

### SigFox {#sigfox}

SigFox is a contender for NB-IoT. It lacks bidirectionality and datarate.

### NB-IoT {#nbiot_lit}

- This section describes NB-IoT in more detail and the setup procedures involved.
- 3GPP
- the UE device is to a large extent/entirely controlled by the network/eNodeB.
  - UE devices must follow NW settings broadcast inside the SIB and allocations for UL/DL data.



Martinez [@Martinez2019] has explored NB-IoT from the perspective of the application developer. When evaluating performance, it would do well to find the limits of the technology as well as find the optimum 'sweet spot' or range for efficient operation.

A user would consider critical characteristics such as energy consumption, coverage, cost, network latency and behavior. Martinez looks at these except for cost, which is better looked at by Ali [@Ali2015]. A set of tests were devised and results showed that in some cases its energy consumption performed better than an LPWAN referenced technology such as LoRa, with the added benefit of guaranteeing delivery. However, the high variability in energy consumption and network latency call into question its reliability especially for mission-critical applications.


## Use Cases {#usecases_intro}

- Public Safety
- Agriculture
- Smart Metering
- Actuator Control
- Real-time Monitoring
- Asset Tracking

* ITS - Logistics
* Health Care
* Industrial Production
* Energy, Utilities
* Retail 

IoT has use case requirements in UL/DL throughput, battery longevity and scalability.

The most popular use case in IoT is smart metering.

### Smart Metering {#smartmetering}

One of the simplest use cases in IoT is smart metering. Periodically sending uplink data at regular intervals from a static location has the advantage of remote monitoring and reducing the need for physical readings. It also opened up new features for users (such as dynamic pricing and usage pattern analysis) and operators (such as load balancing a large number of clients). The clear value proposition and success is partially due to the belief that IoT should be low powered and low data transmissions which still exists today.

**Smart metering can be considered as defeating the purpose of NB-IoT when considering its downlink capabilities.**

Smart metering can be considered the traditional IoT model.

### Actuator Control

## NB-IoT {#nbiot}

Formed by the 3GPP from LTE, NB-IoT was developed within that framework and its capabilities are particularly well suited to smart metering.

![IoT Market representation [@Martinez2019]](../images/1559246290186.png)

Taking it one step further, the 3GPP defined two device categories, namely Cat NB1 and NB2, with the latter adding support for:

- Support of Positioning of Device using OTDOA
  - seamless cell re-selection
- Push to talk voice messaging
- New Device Power Class (14 dBm)
- Multicast transmission

 OTDOA positioning, 

Compared to LTE

- devices are stationary

- intermittent burst transmissions

- low data bandwidth

- delay-tolerant applications

- support for huge number of devices

- deals with poor coverage (indoor penetration)

- battery lifetime of a few years

  

* eDRX and PSM
* Debugging
  * QXDM, UEMonitor etc
  * [@ubloxAppNote2018]



* NB-IoT devices are seen as stationary, only small chunks of data are intermittently transmitted and applications are envisaged as delay-tolerant.
* NB-IoT technology is designed such that it can be used in areas beyond the radio coverage of current
  cellular standards and in devices which must run from battery power for many years. The devices
  will generally send small amounts of data infrequently; a typical usage scenario might be 100 to
  200 bytes sent twice per day for battery powered devices. For mains powered devices the limit is not
  based on battery size, but cost and network bandwidth/resources.
* The system operation is analogous to SMS in that it is a datagram-oriented, stored-and-forward
  system, rather than a GPRS-like IP pipe. This is because NB-IoT devices spend most of their time
  asleep, making possible the required long battery life. The system implements extended DRX cycles
  for paging, but as this window will be limited to save battery life, the delivery of downlink messages
  occurs mainly when the system detects that uplink messages have been received from a device
  (indicating that it is awake). Here a store-and-forward system, an “IoT Platform”, is useful.



### Standing/Positioning {#lit_standing}

We expect selected uptake of each technology in specific application areas and our results show that each technology is better suited to specific applications and their concomitant requirements. Sigfox, NB-IoT, and LoraWAN SF12 performed equally well for applications where MCL (range) is paramount, with LoraWAN SF7 doing slightly worse. In applcitions where the main consideration is scalability, Sigfox, and NB-IoT substantially outperformed the LoraWAN varieties. However, if battery life is the most important consideration, LoraWAN SF7 seems to have the edge, with NB-IoT (the default setup we tested) performing worse. NB-IoT performed the best for uplink throughput, with LoraWAN SF7 coming in second. For all the other two-related metrics evaluated, namely downlink throughput and firmware upgradability, NB-IoT performs substantially better than the other technologies.



* Poor for asset tracking and utility metering.
* Average for smart bicyles, parking, garbage bins, agriculture and intelligent buildings.
* Good for pet tracking, POS, healthcare.
* NB-IoT outperforms SigFox and LoRaWAN in UL/DL throughput, scalability, MCL range and FoTA updates. It is superseded by LoRaWAN in battery life for SF7.
* If NB-IoT worked with the mobile network operators to reduce its RRC-idle phase, it could develop a minimal power consumption to compare with that of LoRaWAN and Sigfox.



* Comparison

[@Martinez2019]

NB-IoT has proven to be competitive in terms of energy consumption,

* Decent study on the operational trade-offs of NB-IoT over LTE.

Complexities

- signalling, dynamic adjustments triggered by network conditions, timing
- competitive in terms of NB-IoT consumption due to 3GPP efforts to be similar to LPWANs

Proprietary spectrum vs ISM bands?

- ISM external interference and share
- otherwise high unpredictability in device behavior

Reliability?

- Delivery guarantee

Delay Tolerance

- high variability in delivery time. Deal-breaker for some applications.

Data rate

- sporadic high bandwidth

Ownership model

- connectivity service, contract, charged per byte
- coverage depends on deployed infrastructure

### LTE Architecture

Although most users interact only with the UE device which runs its own proprietary firmware stack, NB-IoT also has a complex backend architecture.

![LTE_classic_architecture](../images/LTE_classic_architecture.png)

The complexities of LTE architecture further increases the chance of performance degradation with respect to 3GPP specifications due to the vast array of setup parameters. It would be beneficial to analyze the performance of multiple UE devices against various MNO vendors. It is important to note that MNOs may use various vendors in their architecture, and thus this study is mainly focused on the eNodeB vendor which is also UE device facing and has the greatest chance of performance degradation due network quality, RF interference and so forth.

* Both UDP socket commands and datagram commands use the IP data transport through the SGi.

### Hardware {#lit_hardware}

* Modem
* Antenna
* RX/TX lines

### Setup Procedure {#lit_setup}

* There exist application development manuals.
* AT+NCONFIG
  * AUTOCONNECT
  * CR_0859_SI_AVOID
  * CR_0354_0338_SCRAMBLING
* URCs
* APN

### Network Registration and Info {#nw_reg_info}

- By default the SARA-N2 series modules will automatically try and connect to the network. This
  feature will read the SIM for the PLMN and attempt to register with the network. The device will use
  the default APN from the network. The auto-connect feature can be enabled by the +NCONFIG AT
  command. Reset the module to save these settings to the non-volatile memory.
- If the application requires more control over the registration process set the SARA-N2 series
  modules into the manual registration mode. With the auto-connect feature turned off the module is
  able to manually connect to a specific PLMN and specify an APN.
- After a RRC connection is made to the base station the module will try and register with the
  network. If the module IMEI or IMSI is not allowed on the network, the module will disconnect from
  that base station and continue scanning for other base stations. This can be seen if the <mode>
  parameter of the +CSCON AT command shows the “1” and then “0” response without +CEREG
  changing to 1 or 5 means that the module was not able to register on that network.
  In case the module is registered to the network, the <status> parameter of the +CEREG AT
  command will be 1 (registered) or 5 (registered & roaming).
- See [@ubloxAppNote2018]] for a connection status compatibility matrix.

* PCI value is assigned.

The **PCI** value is created from two components - PSS and SSS. The PSS, Primary Synchronization Signal, has the value 0, 1, or 2. The SSS, Secondary Synchronization Signal, can have a value between 0 and 167.

### RRC Connection and Inactivity Timer {#rrc_inactivity}

After network registration or transmitting a data packet, the device usually enters RRC connected (C-DRX) mode for a specified inactivity timeout specified by the network.

- When the module is in RRC connected mode it will be receiving all the base station signaling. The
  average power consumed in this mode is about 48 mA. If the RRC connection is left for 20 s of
  inactivity before the RRC is released, then this will consume about 1 mWh @ 3.6V.
- 48 mA in this mode
- 20 seconds is about 1mWh @ 3.6V
- AT+CSCON
- After a short period, if no messages are being sent from the module, the +CSCON response will be
  “0” to show the RRC connection has been released by the eNodeB.
- At the first registration or when the module wakes from the power save mode (PSM), it performs a
  Random Access CHannel (RACH) procedure to attach to the base station. This establishes a Radio
  Resource Control (RRC) connection to the base station. Once established only the base station can
  release this connection. The module cannot drop the RRC connection other than turning off the
  radio using the AT+CFUN=0 command.
- The base station has an “inactivity” timer for each module and if there is no activity the base station
  will send a RRC release message to the module. The module should respond back to the base station
  with an acknowledgment. The inactivity timer is nominally 20 s.
- The module will be able to receive and send messages immediately when in connected mode.
- During a RRC connection, the +CSCON AT command provide the signalling connection status. It is
  also possible to enable the +CSCON URC.
- When a MO message is sent from the module, the module must first create a RRC connection if
  there is not already established with the base station. This status can be checked using the
  AT+CSCON command.
  To check the signalling connection status issue the +CSCON read command. The second parameter
  of the information text response (+CSCON: <n>,<state>) provides the interested information:
  * 0: idle mode (no RRC connection)
  * 1: connected mode (RRC connection)
- To configure a URC for this command, issue the AT+CSCON=1 command. A URC will be issued at
  each RRC connection status change. 

### Release Assistance {#release_a}

Release assistance requests the eNodeB to release the RRC connection immediately. By avoiding 20 seconds of idle RRC in C-DRX mode, there is a 93% improvement in power consumption for a 200 byte transmission in ECL 1.

[@ubloxAppNote2018]

An example of sending a 200 byte message in ECL 2 with good SNR can include 5 RACH transmission bursts, a Transmission Block Size ~43 bytes, one repetition and taking just over 1 second, consuming 200uWh.

For the same example in bad SNR, the TBS allocated 32 bytes per chunk, with a repetition of 8 and 4. It took 5.5 seconds and consumed 1.07mWh -- fives times as much as before.

- Some applications may not want to wait for the base station’s inactivity timer to expire after 20 s as
  this wastes power from the battery. In Release-13 the “Release Assistance” feature allows the
  module to request for the RRC connection to be dropped as soon as the message has been received
  by the network.
- The flag is noticed by the MME on the network and sends a message back to the eNodeB base
  station to drop the RRC connection. The network must support Release Assistance for this feature.
- After the RRC connection has been released the module then goes in to a period where it could be
  paging the base station. The timer for this period is called T3324. After T3324 has expired the
  module goes into Power Save Mode (PSM). See section 11 for further information



### Power Saving Mechanisms

The NB-IoT protocol allows for power save mode (PSM), and the SARA-N2 series modules also
support a Deep Sleep mode where the module is running at very low current, ~3 $uA$. The module
automatically enters various states depending on the device activity. Here below are listed the
common activities and the various states it will be in after registration.

* T3324 / T3412 timer values

#### T3412 PTAU Timer

* (GPRS timer 3)
*  3GPP TS 24.008 [4], figure 10.5.147a and table 10.5.163a.

* Bits 5 to 1 represent the binary coded timer value. Bits 6 to 8 define the timer value unit for the GPRS
  timer as follows
* 8 7 6
  0 0 0 value is incremented in multiples of 10 minutes
  0 0 1 value is incremented in multiples of 1 hour
  0 1 0 value is incremented in multiples of 10 hours
  0 1 1 value is incremented in multiples of 2 seconds
  1 0 0 value is incremented in multiples of 30 seconds
  1 0 1 value is incremented in multiples of 1 minute
  1 1 0 value is incremented in multiples of 320 hours (Note 1)
  1 1 1 value indicates that the timer is deactivated (Note 2)
* Example: "01000111" = 7 x10 hours = 70 hours
* NOTE 1: This timer value unit is only applicable to the T3312 extended value IE and the T3412
  extended value IE (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [5]). If it is received in an integrity protected message, the
  value shall be interpreted as multiples of 320 hours. Otherwise the value shall be interpreted as
  multiples of 1 hour.
* NOTE 2: This timer value unit is not applicable to the T3412 extended value IE. If this timer value
  is received, the T3412 extended value IE shall be considered as not included in the message (see
  3GPP TS 24.301 [5]).

#### T3324 Active Timer

* The T3324 Timer is reset after a downlink message is received. The negative impact on energy savings should be taken into account if downlink data is fragmented.
* the Active Timer (T3324) controls the time lapse during which the UE device is reachable by the network in RRC Idle, i.e., the number of eDRX cycles.

* Bits 5 to 1 represent the binary coded timer value. Bits 6 to 8 define the timer value unit for the GPRS
  timer as follows
* 8 7 6
  0 0 0 value is incremented in multiples of 2 seconds
  0 0 1 value is incremented in multiples of 1 minute
  0 1 0 value is incremented in multiples of deci-hours
  1 1 1 value indicates that the timer is deactivated
* Example: "00100100" = 4 x1 minute = 4 minutes

#### eDRX Cycles and PTW

* An eDRX cycle is composed of an active phase, controlled by a Paging Time Window (PTW) timer, which ranges from 2.56 s to 40.96 s followed by a sleep phase until the end of the eDRX cycle. Within the PTW, the standard LTE paging is observed.

Extended Discontinuous Reception (eDRX) mode means that paging windows can be scheduled such that the modem can be contacted by the server.

### System Information Blocks (SIB) {#sib}

The SIB describes the method of attachment and what repetitions the UE device must use to first transmit
to the base station. Once a RRC connection is made, the base station then uses the perceived SNR
to configure the uplink allocations the UE device will use to transmit the messages.
Because allocations for each uplink/downlink are dynamically set by the base station it is difficult to
calculate the power consumption of a single message deployed in the field.

* example SIB

### Repetitions and Extended Coverage Level (ECL)

* ECL
* Module interference increases the number of repetitions
* Minimize ECL 2.
* Network operators should provide enough coverage to allow devices to be mostly in coverage class 0
  or 1. Depending on the NB-IoT deployment, the network could have large areas, or devices located in
  deep locations which unfortunately mean they operate in Coverage Class 2.
* Coverage Class 2 uses high repetitions for the RACH process and also higher coding schemes when
  transmitting data and therefore fundamentally consumes more power than it would in the other
  coverage classes.

* 

### UE Device and Network Behavior

* The application can monitor the status of the module’s connection, registration and PSM state by
  polling or configuring URCs. By monitoring the module status the application can behave more
  efficiently, depending on the application type. For example, the application may want to know when
  the module goes into Power Save Mode (PSM).

Register the module to the NB-IoT network before to send or receive any messages. Without being
registered the module will not be able to send or receive any messages.
To check the network registration status issue the +CEREG read command. The second parameter
of the information text response (+CEREG: <mode>,<state>) provides the interested information
* 0: not registered, not registering
* 1: registered
* 2: not registered, but currently in the process to
* 3: registration denied. The application should have a re-try mechanism which does not simply try registration immediately, but has some back-off process
* 4: unknown
* 5: registered, roaming

When the module has started the network search process, poll the +NUESTATS AT command and
view the Rx and Tx Time:

* If Rx Time is increasing then the module is trying to scan for a base station.
* If Tx Time is increasing then the module has found a base station and is trying to communicate
  with it.
* If the Total Power and Signal Power values are different than -32767 (invalid) then the module has
  read the MIB and SIB signals from the base station.
* Once an RRC connection is made, the +CSCON read command will return 1. Turn on the +CSCON
  URC which will be output at each RRC connection change.



If the SIM used is an international SIM (roaming SIM) then the registration process can take many
minutes for the first time. Once the module is registered on that network the PLMN should be
stored in the SIM so that registration is quicker next time. The application can tell if it is using
roaming SIM by the state being “5”.

* The +CEREG URC can be enabled to provide the network registration status. Depending on the
  <mode> parameter it is possible to configure the interested URC parameters (i.e. <mode>=4 or 5 to
  see the provided network timers). See SARA-N2 AT Commands Manual [2] for more details.
* Properly setting the +CEREG AT command (<modem>=3, 4 or 5) it is possible to see the
  registration EMM cause value. These values are described in the 3GPP TS 24.008 [4]. Typical
  causes:
  * #5 IMEI not accepted
  * #11 PLMN not allowed
  * #12 Location Area not allowed
  * #13 Roaming not allowed in this location area
  * #22 Congestion

### AT Commands {#atcommands}

This section outlines the capabilities of the UEs.

Table: Summary AT Command set for Ublox {tbl:atcommands}

|                      | Command    | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Set configuration    | AT+NCONFIG | Change configuration for SI_AVOID, Scrambling etc.           |
| Network Registration | AT+COPS    | This command initiates search for cell towers to connect to depending on MNO-related SIM-card and registers/deregisters accordingly. |
| Set APN              | AT+CGDCONT | Sets the relevant APN for the MNO.                           |
|                      |            |                                                              |

* SARA-N2 series modules implement a FOTA solution based on CoAP. It is possible to configure the
  module’s poll timer for when the module checks the FOTA CoAP server for new firmware. When the
  feature is enabled and a new package is available, the module will automatically download the FOTA
  update and provide URCs about its progress. The module’s firmware is not updated automatically
  when the download has completed and so the application must start the upgrade process step.
* The +UTEST AT command allows the user to set the module in non-signaling (or test) mode, or
  returns to the signaling (or normal) mode. In test/non-signaling mode, the module switches off the
  protocol stack for performing single tests which could not be performed during the signaling mode.
* MO Datagrams sent and received by IoT platform has these commands wrapped internally in a Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) message and sent over UDP sockets. Once the module accepted a datagram it cannot be removed and will be transmitted to the network as soon as radio conditions permit. The only way to clear the module’s transmit queue is to reboot it. In good radio conditions, the transmission might take a few seconds. In bad radio conditions a transmission opportunity may not occur for minutes, days or weeks but the datagram will be transmitted once radio conditions are good enough. When a MO message is queued, the module will try to send the message to the base station. It will only send the next message once the previous message has been sent. If there is a radio link failure (RLF), the device will re-scan the channel ranges and try to reconnect to a base station. There may be a back off time where the device goes into deep-sleep mode before trying again.
* An unsolicited result code (URC) is a string message (provided by the DCE) that is not a response to
  a previous AT command. It can be output, when enabled, at any time to inform the DTE of a specific
  event or status change.

When it comes to base stations, the user does not have control over the inactivity timer. Release assistance can request the eNB/network to disconnect the modem from Radio Resource Control (RRC) connected mode.

When the module is synchronized to the base station, the +NUESTATS AT command is able to describe the radio, cell, BLER, throughput statistics and other signaling info received.
The most useful statistic is the "RADIO" type.

### Application Architecture

* ![1569744612309](../images/1569744612309.png)
* At the far left the customer’s device contains a u-blox NB-IoT module that communicates over the radio network with a cell tower that supports the NB-IoT network. The cellular network links the cell tower with an IoT platform. This IoT platform stores uplink datagrams from the NB-IoT module. The customer server communicates with the IoT platform to retrieve uplink datagrams and to send downlink datagrams to the NB-IoT. The IoT platform holds downlink datagrams until the NB-IoT module is awake to receive them.
* The SARA-N2 series modules implement basic UDP socket commands for directly communicating with an external service. With these commands the customer can build a simple IoT platform. With an external processor other IoT layers could be implemented to aid this system design. SARA-N2 series modules support AT commands for general CoAP messaging. This allows the customer to not require CoAP in their external processor.
* Many developers coming from a GPRS type background may expect an always on type connection, normally using TCP. NB-IoT is not session oriented, latencies are much higher and the device will enter a power save mode. This is very different to always-on modems with “chatty” protocols like TCP.
* UDP sockets do not create connections to servers; UDP is a connection-less datagram protocol. Because of this MO messages may not be received by the server and lost. The application should take this in to consideration and provide its own acknowledgements between the UE device and server. CoAP is one protocol which can be used on top of UDP to provide this.
* For resolving the issue of sending MT messages to a very sleepy module, when a MO message is sent to the cloud server, the cloud server will know the module is active and connected to the network. As seen in section 7 the connection is alive until the RRC connection is released by the network and then still contactable when paging inside the T3324 period. If there are MT messages to be sent to the module, the cloud server should send this message in this time.\

Martinez et al. [@Martinez2019] did empirical tests within the Vodafone Network in Barcelona. They observed UE device and NW behavior, measured current traces, and did various tests in different modes.

Table: NW Config {#tbl:nw_config}

| Mode       | NW Configuration                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mode 1** | Inactivity timer = 20s (network default)<br/>T3324 = 0s (disabled)<br/>C-DRX = 2.048s (network default) |
| **Mode 2** | Inactivity timer = Immediate Release<br/>T3324 = 8s<br/>I-DRX = 2.56s<br/>eDRX/PTW = Disabled |
| **Mode 3** | Inactivity timer = Immediate Release<br/>T3324 = 0s (disabled) |

## Telemetry Tests

The SARA-N2 series modules are able to send raw data through UDP sockets to an IP address. The
data sent over the socket AT commands is not wrapped in any other layer, and the data provided is
the data that is sent.

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a datagram-based client/server application protocol
for devices on the constrained network (e.g. low overhead, low-power), designed to easily translate
to HTTP for simplified integration with the web. CoAP clients can use the GET, PUT, POST and
DELETE methods using requests and responses with a CoAP server.

The usage of the Non-IP method during the sending or receiving of messages saves the overhead of
needing to send a UDP IP header.

See [@ubloxAppNote2018] for an Application example.

### UDP

### Echo

For a more advanced check on sending data to an external server, send data to the u-blox echo
server at echo.u-blox.com.
* Because there is no DNS lookup function in the SARA-N2 module series, use the IP address
server which is 195.34.89.241.

Command Response Description
AT+NSOCR="DGRAM",17,10000 0

### COPS

### eDRX

### PTAU

### Ping

Issue the +NPING AT command to check if the module is able to send and receive data.
Check to see if the network can communicate to the internet, or it is needed another accessible
server’s IP address to ping.
To ping Google’s DNS server:
AT+NPING="8.8.8.8"
To ping OpenDNS DNS server:
AT+NPING="208.67.222.222"
The information text response to the +NPING AT command will be issued after a few seconds. If the
information text response is +NPINGERR: 1, the ping has timed out.

* The first ping might fail because it can take a few seconds to connect to the base station. Use
  the +CSCON URC to show when the module is connected.

## Primary Metrics

### Latency and Timing

* **Down link latency**: In applications where downlink latency is a
  critical component, only GPRS will suffice, as it is the only technology in this study that requires constant paging between the base station and the end device. 
* **Down link throughput**: Any applications requiring bi-directional communication of more than 120 bytes per 24 h, should use NB- IoT or GPRS, as Sigfox and LoRaWAN are limited by the duty- cycle limitations of the base station. 

#### TX, RX Time

TX Time is the duration for which the module’s transmitter has been switched on.

RX Time is the duration for which the module’s receiver has been monitored for downlink
activity (both expressed in milliseconds since the last reboot). Together these can be used to
assess the time the module spends in each state and hence estimate the power consumed by
the module.

When the module first tries to register with the network, the Tx time will be zero as it will not have
instantly found a base station. The Rx time will increase to show it is scanning for a base station.
Once a base station is found it is possible to see that it is attempting to transmit to the base station
as the Tx time will start to increase. If the base station does not respond to the module’s Tx, then
the +CSCON: 1 URC will not be issued.

### Power Efficiency

* ~ 10 years battery life

Low power consumption is vital for battery longevity.

* PCB layout, antenna matching and location will have an effect to the overall interference received by the module.
* PSM and eDRX
* On the other hand, although the average power is comparable, peaks in transmission of LoRaWAN’s radio are around 40 mA, while in NB-IoT they reach 220 mA. This causes additional stress on the battery, which has to be managed with care.
* As can be observed, mean values for NB-IoT are similar to the energy that a LoRaWAN device requires to transmit while using the SF12 configuration. The 5th percentile results for NB-IoT (best observed performance) are comparable to the best case performance of LoRaWAN when operating at SF8. This is in our opinion a relevant result, as NB-IoT guarantees packet delivery with similar power consumption.
* The expected achievable lifespan (on average) for a NB-IoT is on the order 2-3 years, depending on the datagram size.
* However, adopters may take into consideration some differences. First, sending larger messages (up to 512 bytes) has almost no impact on NB-IoT.
* In a simple periodic-reporting application with very limited computing requirements5, the average power can be modeled approximately by Eq. \ref{eq:avgpower}, as detailed in [21]:

$$P = \frac{E_{msg}}{T_{msg}}$$ {#eq:avgpower}

* **Power consumption**: In applications where device battery life is
  a crucial factor we recommend, either LoRaWAN or Sigfox, because they are completely asynchronous. We found that the battery life of LoRaWAN SF 7 was five times that of LoRaWAN SF 12 and nearly 25 times that of Sigfox. This is mainly due to the extremely long time-on-air of LoRaWAN SF 12 and Sigfox. If NB- IoT worked with the mobile network operators to reduce its RRC- idle phase, it could develop a minimal power consumption to compare with that of LoRaWAN and Sigfox.
  * It is clear that LoRaWAN SF7 is the most power-efficient, due to the short transmission burst. NB-IoT displays the worst power-consumption, due to the extended RRC-idle state. This can be reduced using Release Assistance as in Section \ref{release_a}.

## Secondary Metrics

### Signal Strength

#### MCL

For IoT devices used in extended coverage situations,
such as deep-indoor devices or remote locations, we recommend either Sigfox or NB-IoT, as they offer a maximum MCL of more than 158 dB. IoT devices for general use would benefit from the large-scale deployment of the GPRS network, which provides excellent coverage because of its legacy infrastructure. It is clear that the extra overhead available in Sigfox, LoRaWAN, and NB-IoT allows for better indoor coverage than GPRS, which means that the LPWAN devices can be used in less than optimal operating conditions. Measured MCL correlates with theoretical values.

#### RSRP

RSRP or "Signal Power" is the power of the wanted part of the receive signal, the NB-IoT part.

#### SNR

Last SNR value.

#### "Total power" or RSSI

It is the radio signal strength within the receive bandwidth (both expressed in 10ths
of a decibel). From this the signal to noise ratio can be calculated.

#### Transmit power

* It is the RF power output from the module. It may be a low number if the
  received signal strength is good (and hence the module assumes that the base station is close
  by).

* Ideally the module
  should consume 230 mA for +23 dBm.
### ECL 

  It is equivalent to "PRACH coverage enhancement level" defined in 3GPP 36.321 [3] sub
  clause 5.1

  * As observed, the ECL has an impact on energy consumption, but not on the delay.

### Throughput

**Throughput**: As throughput differs greatly between the four technologies, comparisons should rather be made in either the licensed (NB-IoT and GPRS) or unlicensed (Sigfox and LoRaWAN) spectrum categories. Applications that require huge amounts of data to be transmitted, such as real-time vehicle fleet monitoring, we recommend GPRS and NB-IoT as they are not duty cycle limited. The choice of GPRS or NB-IoT will be based on the battery life requirements of the IoT device, with NB-IoT having the advantage. In the case of extremely low-throughput applications, such as water meters, power meters, and weather stations, we recommend Sigfox, as it offers a scalable solution with no base station costs involved. Although it limits the 12 byte throughput per 24 h to 140 messages, this is more than the 20 messages offered by LoRaWAN SF12 (TTN).

* As NB-IoT operates in the licensed spectrum, there are no
  throughput restrictions, other than the data-rate restriction. We measured the uplink and downlink data rates in different signal quality environments (distances from the gateway) by querying the modem. The measured downlink rate varied from 2250 to 14,193 bps. We could find no clear correlation between the downlink data rate and the signal quality environment.

#### FOTA Upgrades

GPRS and NB-IoT are able to offer FOTA upgrades to IoT devices, as Sigfox has limited bandwidth. This feature is supported by LoRaWAN, through the fragmentation of large payloads [22].

### Data Overhead

* The module has a limited dynamic message queue size. For IoT applications, the message size should be of the order of tens of bytes. UDP socket commands limit their payload size to 512 bytes.
* There is no indication when the UDP data has been sent.
* Downlink data from the cloud server must also be 512 bytes or less, because otherwise the messages will be lost.
* The module has an internal message buffer. If the module is unable to send the messages to the network before this buffer is full, because the application is queueing quicker than it can send them, then the UE device will return ERROR for the +NSOST/+NSOSTF commands.
* If a message cannot be sent because of communication issues between the module and eNB, the module will attempt to send the message a second time. If this fails, the message will be dropped. As +NSOST/+NSOSTF messages are UDP, there is no indication the message has been dropped.
* The UDP header is about 48-60 bytes in length, and so an application sending 100 bytes will actually send about 160 bytes. For devices in the extreme coverage class 2, this can be quite costly.
* The UE device may later resume the RRC Connected state with that context, thus avoiding the AS setup and saving considerable signaling overhead for the transmission of infrequent small data packets.

### Scalability 

* Lower (sub-500 devices per gateway) scalability of LoRaWAN per base station compared to NB-IoT and GPRS. This low scalability is due to the limited number of channels and the lack of any scheduling between devices. To compensate for the low scalability, an increase in spatially diverse base stations would allow packets to be received by multiple base stations at varying received power levels.
* This simulation showed that with 55,000 devices transmitting the base station would reach the 270 simultaneously transmitting devices that Sigfox claims is possible while still ensuring a 99.9% PDR.
