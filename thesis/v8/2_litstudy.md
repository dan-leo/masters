  2G/GPRS is a sun-setting technology leaving behind a void for LPWANs such as LoRaWAN and SigFox to fill. The viability of NB-IoT being such a technology for South Africa is investigated. Multiple endpoint manufacturers and base station vendors are tested to compare capabilities with respect to power efficiency, latency, signal strength and other metrics. The results proved promising.

# Literature Study {#litstudy}

Considering current literature, several studies provide theoretical models not only for the energy consumption of NB-IoT networks [@Andres-Maldonado2017], but also for their latency and delay bounds [@Feltrin2019], impact of coverage extensions [@Andres-Maldonado2018b], coverage performance [@Adhikary2016], battery lifetimes [@Yeoh2018d],[@Lauridsen2018], theoretically optimal configuration strategies [@Feltrin2018] and overall performance for particular verticals [@Soussi2018],[@Beyene2017b].

Only Martinez [@Martinez2019] focuses effort on the adopter and presents an operational and empirical analysis of the technology when it is deployed in a real network (such as Vodafone in the Metropolitan area of Barcelona). Durand [@Thomas2018] compares different LPWANs empirically including NB-IoT. Despite the unquestionable value of the theoretical models (for example, to understand orders of magnitude or to guess the theoretical upper and lower bounds), an empirical approach provides real insights into the variability that a UE device experiences when deployed in real conditions. This work therefore complements Martinez and related works, and it further provides empirical measurements for UEs that are deployed using a real-world NB-IoT network always while taking the perspective of an application developer.

* GSM RF equipment testing and performance analysis [@Kasbah2005]
* Analysis of NB-IoT Deployment in LTE Guard-Band [@Ratasuk2017c]

Whilst this research is funded by MTN and being aware of internal documentation, this is an independent study which should aid any potential adopters of the technology.

The empirical results of NB-IoT depend on the device used (UE) and underlying LTE vendor architecture of the MNO providing coverage. Thus, 

## LoRaWAN {#lorawan}

LoRaWAN is a contender for NB-IoT. It lacks bidirectionality and data rate.

* LoRaWAN performs better for short messages, but it is subjected to a very high penalty when
  more than one message per data block is required.
* Second, the LoRaWAN reliability mechanism must be ensured at the
  upper layers, and thus may incur higher energy costs.

## Dash7

## SigFox {#sigfox}

SigFox is a contender for NB-IoT. It lacks bidirectionality and datarate.

## NB-IoT {#nbiot_lit}

- This section describes NB-IoT in more detail and the setup procedures involved.
- 3GPP
- the UE device is to a large extent/entirely controlled by the network/eNodeB.
  - UE devices must follow NW settings broadcast inside the SIB and allocations for UL/DL data.



Martinez [@Martinez2019] has explored NB-IoT from the perspective of the application developer. When evaluating performance, it would do well to find the limits of the technology as well as find the optimum 'sweet spot' or range for efficient operation.

A user would consider critical characteristics such as energy consumption, coverage, cost, network latency and behavior. Martinez looks at these except for cost, which is better looked at by Ali [@Ali2015]. A set of tests were devised and results showed that in some cases its energy consumption performed better than an LPWAN referenced technology such as LoRa, with the added benefit of guaranteeing delivery. However, the high variability in energy consumption and network latency call into question its reliability especially for mission-critical applications.

## Standing or Positioning {#lit_standing}

* Comparison

[@Martinez2019]

NB-IoT has proven to be competitive in terms of energy consumption,

* Decent study on the operational trade-offs of NB-IoT over LTE.

Complexities

- signalling, dynamic adjustments triggered by network conditions, timing
- competitive in terms of NB-IoT consumption due to 3GPP efforts to be similar to LPWANs

Proprietary spectrum vs ISM bands?

- ISM external interference and share
- otherwise high unpredictability in device behavior

Reliability?

- Delivery guarantee

Delay Tolerance

- high variability in delivery time. Deal-breaker for some applications.

Data rate

- sporadic high bandwidth

Ownership model

- connectivity service, contract, charged per byte
- coverage depends on deployed infrastructure

## Hardware {#lit_hardware}

* Modem
* Antenna
* RX/TX lines

## Setup Procedure {#lit_setup}

* There exist application development manuals.
* AT+NCONFIG
  * AUTOCONNECT
  * CR_0859_SI_AVOID
  * CR_0354_0338_SCRAMBLING
* URCs
* APN

## Network Registration and Info {#nw_reg_info}

- By default the SARA-N2 series modules will automatically try and connect to the network. This
  feature will read the SIM for the PLMN and attempt to register with the network. The device will use
  the default APN from the network. The auto-connect feature can be enabled by the +NCONFIG AT
  command. Reset the module to save these settings to the non-volatile memory.
- If the application requires more control over the registration process set the SARA-N2 series
  modules into the manual registration mode. With the auto-connect feature turned off the module is
  able to manually connect to a specific PLMN and specify an APN.
- After a RRC connection is made to the base station the module will try and register with the
  network. If the module IMEI or IMSI is not allowed on the network, the module will disconnect from
  that base station and continue scanning for other base stations. This can be seen if the <mode>
  parameter of the +CSCON AT command shows the “1” and then “0” response without +CEREG
  changing to 1 or 5 means that the module was not able to register on that network.
  In case the module is registered to the network, the <status> parameter of the +CEREG AT
  command will be 1 (registered) or 5 (registered & roaming).
- See [@ubloxAppNote2018]] for a connection status compatibility matrix.

* PCI value is assigned.

The **PCI** value is created from two components - PSS and SSS. The PSS, Primary Synchronization Signal, has the value 0, 1, or 2. The SSS, Secondary Synchronization Signal, can have a value between 0 and 167.

## RRC Connection and Inactivity Timer {#rrc_inactivity}

After network registration or transmitting a data packet, the device usually enters RRC connected (C-DRX) mode for a specified inactivity timeout specified by the network.

- When the module is in RRC connected mode it will be receiving all the base station signaling. The
  average power consumed in this mode is about 48 mA. If the RRC connection is left for 20 s of
  inactivity before the RRC is released, then this will consume about 1 mWh @ 3.6V.
- 48 mA in this mode
- 20 seconds is about 1mWh @ 3.6V
- AT+CSCON
- After a short period, if no messages are being sent from the module, the +CSCON response will be
  “0” to show the RRC connection has been released by the eNodeB.
- At the first registration or when the module wakes from the power save mode (PSM), it performs a
  Random Access CHannel (RACH) procedure to attach to the base station. This establishes a Radio
  Resource Control (RRC) connection to the base station. Once established only the base station can
  release this connection. The module cannot drop the RRC connection other than turning off the
  radio using the AT+CFUN=0 command.
- The base station has an “inactivity” timer for each module and if there is no activity the base station
  will send a RRC release message to the module. The module should respond back to the base station
  with an acknowledgment. The inactivity timer is nominally 20 s.
- The module will be able to receive and send messages immediately when in connected mode.
- During a RRC connection, the +CSCON AT command provide the signalling connection status. It is
  also possible to enable the +CSCON URC.
- When a MO message is sent from the module, the module must first create a RRC connection if
  there is not already established with the base station. This status can be checked using the
  AT+CSCON command.
  To check the signalling connection status issue the +CSCON read command. The second parameter
  of the information text response (+CSCON: <n>,<state>) provides the interested information:
  * 0: idle mode (no RRC connection)
  * 1: connected mode (RRC connection)
- To configure a URC for this command, issue the AT+CSCON=1 command. A URC will be issued at
  each RRC connection status change. 

## Release Assistance {#release_a}

Release assistance requests the eNodeB to release the RRC connection immediately. By avoiding 20 seconds of idle RRC in C-DRX mode, there is a 93% improvement in power consumption for a 200 byte transmission in ECL 1.

[@ubloxAppNote2018]

An example of sending a 200 byte message in ECL 2 with good SNR can include 5 RACH transmission bursts, a Transmission Block Size ~43 bytes, one repetition and taking just over 1 second, consuming 200uWh.

For the same example in bad SNR, the TBS allocated 32 bytes per chunk, with a repetition of 8 and 4. It took 5.5 seconds and consumed 1.07mWh -- fives times as much as before.

- Some applications may not want to wait for the base station’s inactivity timer to expire after 20 s as
  this wastes power from the battery. In Release-13 the “Release Assistance” feature allows the
  module to request for the RRC connection to be dropped as soon as the message has been received
  by the network.
- The flag is noticed by the MME on the network and sends a message back to the eNodeB base
  station to drop the RRC connection. The network must support Release Assistance for this feature.
- After the RRC connection has been released the module then goes in to a period where it could be
  paging the base station. The timer for this period is called T3324. After T3324 has expired the
  module goes into Power Save Mode (PSM). See section 11 for further information



## Power Saving Mechanisms

The NB-IoT protocol allows for power save mode (PSM), and the SARA-N2 series modules also
support a Deep Sleep mode where the module is running at very low current, ~3 $uA$. The module
automatically enters various states depending on the device activity. Here below are listed the
common activities and the various states it will be in after registration.

* T3324 / T3412 timer values

### T3412 PTAU Timer

* (GPRS timer 3)
*  3GPP TS 24.008 [4], figure 10.5.147a and table 10.5.163a.

* Bits 5 to 1 represent the binary coded timer value. Bits 6 to 8 define the timer value unit for the GPRS
  timer as follows
* 8 7 6
  0 0 0 value is incremented in multiples of 10 minutes
  0 0 1 value is incremented in multiples of 1 hour
  0 1 0 value is incremented in multiples of 10 hours
  0 1 1 value is incremented in multiples of 2 seconds
  1 0 0 value is incremented in multiples of 30 seconds
  1 0 1 value is incremented in multiples of 1 minute
  1 1 0 value is incremented in multiples of 320 hours (Note 1)
  1 1 1 value indicates that the timer is deactivated (Note 2)
* Example: "01000111" = 7 x10 hours = 70 hours
* NOTE 1: This timer value unit is only applicable to the T3312 extended value IE and the T3412
  extended value IE (see 3GPP TS 24.301 [5]). If it is received in an integrity protected message, the
  value shall be interpreted as multiples of 320 hours. Otherwise the value shall be interpreted as
  multiples of 1 hour.
* NOTE 2: This timer value unit is not applicable to the T3412 extended value IE. If this timer value
  is received, the T3412 extended value IE shall be considered as not included in the message (see
  3GPP TS 24.301 [5]).

### T3324 Active Timer

* The T3324 Timer is reset after a downlink message is received. The negative impact on energy savings should be taken into account if downlink data is fragmented.
* the Active Timer (T3324) controls the time lapse during which the UE device is reachable by the network in RRC Idle, i.e., the number of eDRX cycles.

* Bits 5 to 1 represent the binary coded timer value. Bits 6 to 8 define the timer value unit for the GPRS
  timer as follows
* 8 7 6
  0 0 0 value is incremented in multiples of 2 seconds
  0 0 1 value is incremented in multiples of 1 minute
  0 1 0 value is incremented in multiples of deci-hours
  1 1 1 value indicates that the timer is deactivated
* Example: "00100100" = 4 x1 minute = 4 minutes

### eDRX Cycles and PTW

* An eDRX cycle is composed of an active phase, controlled by a Paging Time Window (PTW) timer, which ranges from 2.56 s to 40.96 s followed by a sleep phase until the end of the eDRX cycle. Within the PTW, the standard LTE paging is observed.

Extended Discontinuous Reception (eDRX) mode means that paging windows can be scheduled such that the modem can be contacted by the server.

## System Information Blocks (SIB) {#sib}

The SIB describes the method of attachment and what repetitions the UE device must use to first transmit
to the base station. Once a RRC connection is made, the base station then uses the perceived SNR
to configure the uplink allocations the UE device will use to transmit the messages.
Because allocations for each uplink/downlink are dynamically set by the base station it is difficult to
calculate the power consumption of a single message deployed in the field.

* example SIB

## Repetitions and Extended Coverage Level (ECL)

* ECL
* Module interference increases the number of repetitions
* Minimize ECL 2.
* Network operators should provide enough coverage to allow devices to be mostly in coverage class 0
  or 1. Depending on the NB-IoT deployment, the network could have large areas, or devices located in
  deep locations which unfortunately mean they operate in Coverage Class 2.
* Coverage Class 2 uses high repetitions for the RACH process and also higher coding schemes when
  transmitting data and therefore fundamentally consumes more power than it would in the other
  coverage classes.

* 

## UE Device and Network Behavior

* The application can monitor the status of the module’s connection, registration and PSM state by
  polling or configuring URCs. By monitoring the module status the application can behave more
  efficiently, depending on the application type. For example, the application may want to know when
  the module goes into Power Save Mode (PSM).

Register the module to the NB-IoT network before to send or receive any messages. Without being
registered the module will not be able to send or receive any messages.
To check the network registration status issue the +CEREG read command. The second parameter
of the information text response (+CEREG: <mode>,<state>) provides the interested information
* 0: not registered, not registering
* 1: registered
* 2: not registered, but currently in the process to
* 3: registration denied. The application should have a re-try mechanism which does not simply try registration immediately, but has some back-off process
* 4: unknown
* 5: registered, roaming

When the module has started the network search process, poll the +NUESTATS AT command and
view the Rx and Tx Time:

* If Rx Time is increasing then the module is trying to scan for a base station.
* If Tx Time is increasing then the module has found a base station and is trying to communicate
  with it.
* If the Total Power and Signal Power values are different than -32767 (invalid) then the module has
  read the MIB and SIB signals from the base station.
* Once an RRC connection is made, the +CSCON read command will return 1. Turn on the +CSCON
  URC which will be output at each RRC connection change.



If the SIM used is an international SIM (roaming SIM) then the registration process can take many
minutes for the first time. Once the module is registered on that network the PLMN should be
stored in the SIM so that registration is quicker next time. The application can tell if it is using
roaming SIM by the state being “5”.

* The +CEREG URC can be enabled to provide the network registration status. Depending on the
  <mode> parameter it is possible to configure the interested URC parameters (i.e. <mode>=4 or 5 to
  see the provided network timers). See SARA-N2 AT Commands Manual [2] for more details.
* Properly setting the +CEREG AT command (<modem>=3, 4 or 5) it is possible to see the
  registration EMM cause value. These values are described in the 3GPP TS 24.008 [4]. Typical
  causes:
  * #5 IMEI not accepted
  * #11 PLMN not allowed
  * #12 Location Area not allowed
  * #13 Roaming not allowed in this location area
  * #22 Congestion

## Data transmission

The SARA-N2 series modules are able to send raw data through UDP sockets to an IP address. The
data sent over the socket AT commands is not wrapped in any other layer, and the data provided is
the data that is sent.

The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a datagram-based client/server application protocol
for devices on the constrained network (e.g. low overhead, low-power), designed to easily translate
to HTTP for simplified integration with the web. CoAP clients can use the GET, PUT, POST and
DELETE methods using requests and responses with a CoAP server.

The usage of the Non-IP method during the sending or receiving of messages saves the overhead of
needing to send a UDP IP header.

See [@ubloxAppNote2018] for an Application example.

### Ping

Issue the +NPING AT command to check if the module is able to send and receive data.
Check to see if the network can communicate to the internet, or it is needed another accessible
server’s IP address to ping.
To ping Google’s DNS server:
AT+NPING="8.8.8.8"
To ping OpenDNS DNS server:
AT+NPING="208.67.222.222"
The information text response to the +NPING AT command will be issued after a few seconds. If the
information text response is +NPINGERR: 1, the ping has timed out.

* The first ping might fail because it can take a few seconds to connect to the base station. Use
  the +CSCON URC to show when the module is connected.

### Echo

For a more advanced check on sending data to an external server, send data to the u-blox echo
server at echo.u-blox.com.
* Because there is no DNS lookup function in the SARA-N2 module series, use the IP address
server which is 195.34.89.241.

Command Response Description
AT+NSOCR="DGRAM",17,10000 0
OK

AT+NSOST=0,"195.34.89.241",7,5,"0102

,"0102030405",0
OK

## Available Metrics

When the module is synchronized to the base station and is receiving the signaling the +NUESTATS AT command is able to describe the radio, cell, BLER and throughput statistics.
The most useful statistic is the "RADIO" type.

### RSRP

It is the power of the wanted part of the receive signal, the NB-IoT part.

### Total power

It is the radio signal strength within the receive bandwidth (both expressed in 10ths
of a decibel). From this the signal to noise ratio can be calculated.

### Transmit power

* It is the RF power output from the module. It may be a low number if the
  received signal strength is good (and hence the module assumes that the base station is close
  by).

*  Ideally the module
  should consume 230 mA for +23 dBm.

### TX, RX Time

TX Time is the duration for which the module’s transmitter has been switched on.

RX Time is the duration for which the module’s receiver has been monitored for downlink
activity (both expressed in milliseconds since the last reboot). Together these can be used to
assess the time the module spends in each state and hence estimate the power consumed by
the module.

When the module first tries to register with the network, the Tx time will be zero as it will not have
instantly found a base station. The Rx time will increase to show it is scanning for a base station.
Once a base station is found it is possible to see that it is attempting to transmit to the base station
as the Tx time will start to increase. If the base station does not respond to the module’s Tx, then
the +CSCON: 1 URC will not be issued.

### ECL 

It is equivalent to "PRACH coverage enhancement level" defined in 3GPP 36.321 [3] sub
clause 5.1

* As observed, the ECL has an impact on energy consumption, but not on the delay.

### SNR

Last SNR value.

## Latency {#latency}

* < 10 seconds
* 

## Power Consumption {#power}

* ~ 10 years battery life

Low power consumption is vital for battery longevity.

* PCB layout, antenna matching and location will have an effect to the overall interference received by the module.
* PSM and eDRX
* On the other hand, although the average power is comparable, peaks in transmission of LoRaWAN’s radio are around 40 mA, while in NB-IoT they reach 220 mA. This causes additional stress on the battery, which has to be managed with care.
* As can be observed, mean values for NB-IoT are similar to the energy that a LoRaWAN device requires to transmit while using the SF12 configuration. The 5th percentile results for NB-IoT (best observed performance) are comparable to the best case performance of LoRaWAN when operating at SF8. This is in our opinion a relevant result, as NB-IoT guarantees packet delivery with similar power consumption.
* The expected achievable lifespan (on average) for a NB-IoT is on the order 2-3 years, depending on the datagram size.
* However, adopters may take into consideration some differences. First, sending larger messages (up to 512 bytes) has almost no impact on NB-IoT.
* In a simple periodic-reporting application with very limited computing requirements5, the average power can be modeled approximately by Eq. \ref{eq:avgpower}, as detailed in [21]:

$$P = \frac{E_{msg}}{T_{msg}}$$ {#eq:avgpower}

* 

## Data Usage

* The module has a limited dynamic message queue size. For IoT applications, the message size should be of the order of tens of bytes. UDP socket commands limit their payload size to 512 bytes.
* There is no indication when the UDP data has been sent.
* Downlink data from the cloud server must also be 512 bytes or less, because otherwise the messages will be lost.
* The module has an internal message buffer. If the module is unable to send the messages to the network before this buffer is full, because the application is queueing quicker than it can send them, then the UE device will return ERROR for the +NSOST/+NSOSTF commands.
* If a message cannot be sent because of communication issues between the module and eNB, the module will attempt to send the message a second time. If this fails, the message will be dropped. As +NSOST/+NSOSTF messages are UDP, there is no indication the message has been dropped.
* The UDP header is about 48-60 bytes in length, and so an application sending 100 bytes will actually send about 160 bytes. For devices in the extreme coverage class 2, this can be quite costly.
* The UE device may later resume the RRC Connected state with that context, thus avoiding the AS setup and saving considerable signaling overhead for the transmission of infrequent small data packets.

## Application Architecture

* ![1569744612309](../images/1569744612309.png)
* At the far left the customer’s device contains a u-blox NB-IoT module that communicates over the radio network with a cell tower that supports the NB-IoT network. The cellular network links the cell tower with an IoT platform. This IoT platform stores uplink datagrams from the NB-IoT module. The customer server communicates with the IoT platform to retrieve uplink datagrams and to send downlink datagrams to the NB-IoT. The IoT platform holds downlink datagrams until the NB-IoT module is awake to receive them.
* The SARA-N2 series modules implement basic UDP socket commands for directly communicating with an external service. With these commands the customer can build a simple IoT platform. With an external processor other IoT layers could be implemented to aid this system design. SARA-N2 series modules support AT commands for general CoAP messaging. This allows the customer to not require CoAP in their external processor.
* Many developers coming from a GPRS type background may expect an always on type connection, normally using TCP. NB-IoT is not session oriented, latencies are much higher and the device will enter a power save mode. This is very different to always-on modems with “chatty” protocols like TCP.
* UDP sockets do not create connections to servers; UDP is a connection-less datagram protocol. Because of this MO messages may not be received by the server and lost. The application should take this in to consideration and provide its own acknowledgements between the UE device and server. CoAP is one protocol which can be used on top of UDP to provide this.
* For resolving the issue of sending MT messages to a very sleepy module, when a MO message is sent to the cloud server, the cloud server will know the module is active and connected to the network. As seen in section 7 the connection is alive until the RRC connection is released by the network and then still contactable when paging inside the T3324 period. If there are MT messages to be sent to the module, the cloud server should send this message in this time.
