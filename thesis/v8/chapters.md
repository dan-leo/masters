**LTE Cat-NB (Narrowband) characterization of user equipment (UE) and mobile network operators (MNOs)**

# Introduction

Application developers and cellular service providers alike are interested in implementing NB-IoT (LTE Cat-NB) as an alternative to LoRaWAN, SigFox and other LPWANs. Application developers require network coverage, and cellular service providers require consumer and enterprise demand or reasonable motivation before rolling it out nationally. Although there is a great deal of theoretical analysis and simulations in research, the lack of empirical evidence may be contributing to the impasse of growth in the network technology. This thesis aims to bridge that divide.



A number of tests have been developed, performed and analyzed for multiple UE (Ublox and Quectel) and MNOs (MTN and Vodacom) via ZTE and Nokia vendors. Power saving, latency, RF, packet and network metrics are evaluated using UDP, Echo, COPS (network registration), eDRX and PTAU tests.
