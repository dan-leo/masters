# Introduction {#intro}

This study evaluates the performance of NB-IoT.

A number of tests have been developed, performed and analyzed for multiple UEs (Ublox and Quectel) and MNOs (MTN and Vodacom) via ZTE and Nokia vendors. Power saving, latency, RF, packet and network metrics are evaluated using UDP, Echo, COPS (network registration), eDRX and PTAU tests.

NB-IoT is a promising contender to fill the role that 2G/GPRS leaves behind as countries around the world schedule its retirement. There are many alternative LPWANs, however.

## Why NB-IoT?

NB-IoT shows performance benefits over alternatives in terms of uplink and downlink throughput, range. Energy consumption remains a problem [@Durand2019], [@Martinez2019].

## Problem statement {#probstat}

To evaluate the performance of NB-IoT using multiple user equipment (UE) and (MNOs).

There exists an interest in implementing NB-IoT (LTE Cat-NB) as an alternative to LoRaWAN, SigFox and other LPWANs. Application developers require network coverage, and cellular service providers require consumer and enterprise demand or reasonable motivation before rolling it out nationally. Although there is a great deal of theoretical analysis and simulations in research, the lack of empirical evidence may be contributing to a general uncertainty in the standing of the technology with respect to alternatives and a thus a slower adoption. This thesis aims to bridge that divide by evaluating NB-IoT's performance empirically using a set of metrics and to make certain estimations.

## Research Objectives {#resobj}

Evaluate:

* Latency
* Energy
* Packet size

Estimate:

* Battery life
* Data billing

Aim. Evaluate robustness, stability, capabilities, claimed vs actual. Core features/metrics.

## Terminology {#terminology}

This section briefly introduces various IoT, LPWAN, LTE and metric related topics and is expanded upon in Section \ref{background}.

The Internet of Things (IoT in Section \ref{iot}) is a blanket term for smart devices that connect to the internet. These devices are typically found in remote or urban areas where it would be more efficient for a device to control and monitor the status of the surrounding environment than human intervention. 

Wired devices usually connect using ethernet, although it is not uncommon to use industry grade protocols such as RS232, CAN, ModBus, ProffiBus, and so on before data reaches a network hub and the internet. On the other hand, wireless connections have the benefit of easy installation and really shine in inaccessible areas. It is quite effective to connect Bluetooth and WiFi for short range applications, or using Low Powered Wide Area Networks (LPWANs in Section \ref{lpwans}) such as LoRaWAN, SigFox and NB-IoT for ranges exceeding a few kilometers and especially for limited sources of power.

Long-Range Radio (LoRa or LoRaWAN in Section \ref{lorawan}) uses chirp-spread-spectrum (CSS) modulation to make it quite immune to doppler effect motion and SigFox (Section \ref{sigfox}) uses binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) which increases noise immunity.

LPWANs enable many use cases (Section \ref{usecases}) in sensors, actuator control and location tracking to name a few.

GSM and GPRS fall under 2G and 2.5G which started development in the early 90s. Data transmission (such as USSD, SMS, WAP, IP) is circuit-switched over GSM, and packet-switched over GPRS. Circuit switched data is billed per time interval such as seconds or minutes, and packet-switched is charged per number of bytes (kB, MB, etcetra). It evolved into 3G in Release 99 at the turn of the millenium and LTE in Release 8 (Q4 2008).

Long Term Evolution (LTE) is a cellular architecture which is a subset of an even more complex 3GPP body that guides its development. In LTE, the narrowband category is known as LTE Cat-NB or NB-IoT. For their M2M applications, LTE Cat-M is similar, yet it features VoIP, faster throughput and _. There are two different versions of NB-IoT, with LTE Cat-NB1 being release 13 and LTE Cat-NB2 being release 14. Their specifications have been frozen in Q1 2016 and mid-2017, respectively.

## Background {#background}

Uncertainty about NB-IoT.

If NB-IoT worked with the mobile network operators to reduce its RRC-idle phase, it could develop a minimal power consumption to compare with that of LoRaWAN and Sigfox.

---

Although NB-IoT joined LPWANs circa 2016-2017, demand uptake among consumer and industry in South Africa is still slow as well as national coverage rollout. Worldwide it has 30% (rough estimate?) population coverage with most in Europe, China and lately America (mid-2019).

In South Africa, NB-IoT has most of its coverage in the Gauteng province as well as a few sites in other towns and cities. Although Gauteng only covers 1.49% of the land mass in South Africa, it holds ~22% of its ~57 million people so it is great as a live trial run before pushing for national coverage.

It is based off of LTE, making integration and upgrading of existing infrastructure more seamless than an entirely separate technology, although it also brings with the drawbacks of legacy LTE. This includes the benefit of low power, and the low bandwidth trade off which is suitable for smart devices and IoT.

An application developer in IoT is interested in a hands-on approach with the technology they will use, with the aim of scaling up production such that volumes of 1000 devices or more can be reached. Thus an empirical evaluation of the technology is focused on in this thesis, especially when considering that much of the research is analytical or simulation bound.

Martinez [@Martinez2019] has explored NB-IoT from the perspective of the application developer. It is well thought out, and follows a similar path to this thesis. When evaluating performance, it would do well to find the limits of the technology as well as find the optimum 'sweet spot' or range for efficient operation.

A user would consider critical characteristics such as energy consumption, coverage, cost, network latency and behavior. Martinez looks at these except for cost, which is better looked at by Ali [@Ali2015]. A set of tests were devised and results showed that in some cases its energy consumption performed better than an LPWAN referenced technology such as LoRa, with the added benefit of guaranteeing delivery. However, the high variability in energy consumption and network latency call into question its reliability especially for mission-critical applications.

Network operators are looking to enter the LPWAN sphere. 3GPP have made this possible by adapting LTE into Cat-M and NB-IoT.

Application developers are always on the lookout for viable technologies, and tend to use the most prolific ones

## Internet of Things{#iot}

In 2014, Gartner estimated that Internet of Things (IoT) had reached the height of inflated expectations, and the hype it generated has resulted in a rich ecosystem of technologies.

![Gartner's IoT hype 2014](../images/hype-cycle-2014-100371840-large.idge.jpeg)

Hype yields investment, regardless whether the underlying innovation holds value. IoT holds value in connecting things to the internet, as in its namesake. This can be seen in the venture capital injection into companies and start-ups and the number of connected devices over time.

![Number of connected devices [@Ali2015]](../images/Expected-number-of-connected-devices-to-the-Internet-This-chart-is-obtained-from-recent.png)



IoT shows great potential for exponential growth, and unless a technology disruption occurs which means we do not require connections or our devices, then there is undoubtedly an [uptrend](https://amarketresearchgazette.com/global-narrowband-iot-nb-iot-market-2019-2025-vodafone-china-unicom-china-telecom-att-etisalat-telstra-orange-telefonica-sk-telecom-deutsche-telekom/). As Gartner predicts, we should be in the plateau of productivity now, and this can be observed by looking at the current news regarding the technology.

A few months before publishing, [AT&T announces](https://blog.nordicsemi.com/getconnected/att-launches-nb-iot-network-in-usa) nation-wide coverage of NB-IoT in the USA, alongside its existing LTE Cat-M coverage. Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone cover Europe (news?) and China enables millions more IoT devices [@china2019].

Although there are many ways to connect IoT to the internet, NB-IoT is an LPWAN which is the focus of this study.

## Low-Powered Wide-Area Networks {#lpwans}

There are many wireless technologies out there, with some standardized (including Bluetooth, 6LowPan, RPMA, Weightless, IETF 6TiSCH, SigFox, LoRaWAN, Dash7 amongst others). Many are proprietary to retain company value and they try to meet application specific requirements also limited by technological constraints. Matching custom applications with a wireless technology is non-trivial as there is no silver bullet that matches all use-cases. On the contrary, many technologies overlap in their capabilities.

LPWANs enable a vast array of use cases.

## Use cases {#usecases}

- Public Safety
- Agriculture
- Smart Metering

The most popular use case in IoT is smart metering.

## Smart metering {#smartmetering}

One of the simplest use cases in IoT is smart metering. Periodically sending uplink data at regular intervals from a static location has the advantage of remote monitoring and reducing the need for physical readings. It also opened up new features for users (such as dynamic pricing and usage pattern analysis) and operators (such as load balancing a large number of clients). The clear value proposition and success is partially due to the belief that IoT should be low powered and low data transmissions which still exists today.

Smart metering can be considered the traditional IoT model.

## Push-pull model

Traditionally, IoT devices push data to the internet at regular intervals. This push model can be considered quite energy inefficient, especially when the data is only occasionally actionable. For example, in asset tracking or remote monitoring.

A pull model is ideal for dynamic rule engines, pulling data only when necessary and ultimately edge computing, where building an application around this idea can greatly enhance battery life.

## Edge computing

Edge computing is the practice of offloading cloud processes to the endpoint. It saves on data overhead, especially when there are data charges involved and battery longevity is desired.

Since NB-IoT is optimized for downlink communications, it can be the ideal candidate.

## NB-IoT {#nbiot}

Formed by the 3GPP from LTE, NB-IoT was developed within that framework and its capabilities are particularly well suited to smart metering.

![IoT Market representation [@Martinez2019]](../images/1559246290186.png)

Taking it one step further, the 3GPP defined two device categories, namely Cat NB1 and NB2, with the latter adding support for:

- Support of Positioning of Device using OTDOA
  - seamless cell re-selection
- Push to talk voice messaging
- New Device Power Class (14 dBm)
- Multicast transmission

 OTDOA positioning, 

Compared to LTE

- devices are stationary
- intermittent burst transmissions
- low data bandwidth
- delay-tolerant applications
- support for huge number of devices
- deals with poor coverage (indoor penetration)
- battery lifetime of a few years

Although most users interact only with the UE which runs its own proprietary firmware stack, NB-IoT also has a complex backend architecture.

## LTE Architecture

![LTE_classic_architecture](../images/LTE_classic_architecture.png)

The complexities of LTE architecture further increases the chance of performance degradation with respect to 3GPP specifications due to the vast array of setup parameters. It would be beneficial to analyze the performance of multiple UE against various MNO vendors. It is important to note that MNOs may use various vendors in their architecture, and thus this study is mainly focused on the eNodeB vendor which is also UE facing and has the greatest chance of performance degradation due network quality, RF interference and so forth.

## Performance evaluation

It would be useful for the application developer to know the boundaries resulting from this approach. Drawbacks and optimizations targeting IoT can be discussed. The application developer is a potential adopter of the technology and focuses on parameters that fall within end-user control.

Cellular operators would also benefit by knowing where they can improve upon their configurations and equipment.

To this end it would be beneficial to:

- Analyze critical metrics at the core of NB-IoT, such as energy consumption, coverage, cost and latency.
- Create a testing framework to characterize NB-IoT devices in actual operation and using various networks.
- Set optimal operating boundaries based on the obtained results. This should also re-evaluate suitability in certain use cases.
- Compare NB-IoT to Dash7, which can be considered a prominent bi-directional contender. It has the capability of using LoRa's physical layer (RF frontend) so has the added benefit of long range.

There are over 50 MNOs in the world that are using NB-IoT, yet most draw from a subset of the [top 5 LTE vendors](https://www.rcrwireless.com/20160531/network-infrastructure/top-5-wireless-infrastructure-makers-tag4-tag99):

1. Huawei
2. Ericsson
3. Nokia
4. ZTE
5. Samsung

## MNO Vendors

In South Africa, there are two mobile network operators trialing NB-IoT and combined they use four of the top LTE vendors. Samsung has started using NB-IoT only as recently as May 2019, [announcing a partnership with KT to create a Public Safety (PS-LTE) network](https://enterpriseiotinsights.com/20190506/nb-iot/samsung-kt-launch-nbiot-service-through-ps-lte-network-korea). They're also implementing device-to-device (D2D) communications to increase connectivity in unfavourable conditions.

Table: MNOs and their BTS Vendors

| BTS Vendors | Cellular operator (MNO) |
| ----------- | ----------------------- |
| Nokia       | Vodacom                 |
| ZTE         | MTN                     |
| Huawei      | Vodacom                 |
| Ericsson    | MTN                     |

Theoretically, one can assume that these manufacturers meet 3GPP's specifications and that they have set up an optimal environment.

With a testing framework, one can evaluate these capabilities in a transparent manner for both developers and cellular operators alike and work towards improving the quality thereof.

Cellular operators are in control of some things, and users of others.

|                             | Cellular operators | Users       |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| NB-IoT Base stations (BTS)  | **X**              |             |
| NB-IoT User Equipment (UE)  |                    | **X**       |
| LoRaWAN Gateways            |                    | **X**       |
| LoRaWAN Devices             |                    | **X**       |
| NB-IoT licensed spectrum    |                    | billed      |
| LoRaWAN unlicensed spectrum |                    | duty-cycled |
|                             |                    |             |
|                             |                    |             |

MNO/BTS Vendors are open to all UE manufacturers.

## UE Manufacturers

UE devices specifically used:

- Ublox Sara N200
- Quectel BC95

and the following recommended in future:

- Nordic nRF9160
- SimCom SIM7020E

### Ublox

### Quectel

### Nordic

### SimCom

These UEs all share AT commands as the API to control their capabilities.

## AT Commands {#atcommands}

This section outlines the capabilities of the UEs.

Table: Summary AT Command set for Ublox

|                      | Command    | Description                                                  |
| -------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Set configuration    | AT+NCONFIG | Change configuration for SI_AVOID, Scrambling etc.           |
| Network Registration | AT+COPS    | This command initiates search for cell towers to connect to depending on MNO-related SIM-card and registers/deregisters accordingly. |
| Set APN              | AT+CGDCONT | Sets the relevant APN for the MNO.                           |
|                      |            |                                                              |

When it comes to base stations, the user does not have control over the inactivity timer. Release assistance can request the eNB/network to disconnect the modem from Radio Resource Control (RRC) connected mode.

## Thesis structure {#thesis-struct}

NB-IoT is introduced to the reader in Chapter \ref{intro}. A literature study reviews the current empirical research in Chapter \ref{litstudy}. Design and methodology shows the steps taken to capture different metrics and process the resulting dataset in Chapter \ref{design}. Results are analyzed in Chapter \ref{results} and discussed with recommendations in Chapter \ref{#discussion}. Lastly, a conclusion is made in Chapter \ref{conclusion}.

# Literature Study {#litstudy}

Several studies provide theoretical models not only for the energy consumption of NB-IoT networks [@Andres-Maldonado2017], but also for their latency and delay bounds [@Feltrin2019], impact of coverage extensions [@Andres-Maldonado2018b], coverage performance [@Adhikary2016], battery lifetimes [@Yeoh2018d],[@Lauridsen2018], (theoretically) optimal configuration strategies [@Feltrin2018] and overall performance for particular verticals [@Soussi2018],[@Beyene2017b].

Only Martinez [@Martinez2019] focuses effort on the adopter and presents an operational and empirical analysis of the technology when it is deployed in a real network (such as Vodafone in the Metropolitan area of Barcelona).

Despite the unquestionable value of the theoretical models (for example, to understand orders of magnitude or to guess the theoretical upper and lower bounds), an empirical approach provides real insights into the variability that a UE experiences when deployed in real conditions. This work therefore goes in this direction as a complement to Martinez and related works, and it further provides empirical measurements for UEs that are deployed using a real-world NB-IoT network always while taking the perspective of an application developer.

# Design and Methodology {#design}

## Approach

The aim is to compare user equipment (UE) against mobile network operators (MNOs) with a set of tests that evaluate NB-IoT's performance according to a set of metrics which highlight striking differences due to the underlying complexities of LTE architecture.

Four mobile network operators (MNOs) are compared in South Africa according to the underlying vendor
infrastructure used, namely Nokia and ZTE in the Cape/coastal regions and Ericsson and Huawei based in Gauteng/inland regions.

More than one UE is used to improve the accuracy of the result, namely Ublox and Quectel. There is an open possibility to test SimCom and Nordic as well.

A unit testing framework has been carefully prepared in Python in combination with a Hewlett Packard rotary RF attenuator in 10dBm steps. 

Table: UE, NW and main metric comparisons

| NW Vendors | UE Manufacturers | Main Metrics     | Secondary Metrics | Estimates    |
| ---------- | ---------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| ZTE        | Ublox            | Power Efficiency | Signal Strength   | Battery Life |
| Nokia      | Quectel          | Latency          | Throughput        | Data Billing |
| Ericsson   | Nordic           | Data usage       |                   |              |
| Huawei     | SimCom           |                  |                   |              |

## Available Metrics

### Reported TX Time

## Measured Metrics

## Tests

### UDP {#udp}

To test the capability of sending to the internet for multiple UEs, a simple protocol is necessary. TCP, MQTT, CoAP and other protocols are all based on the same IP infrastructure that UDP uses, yet not all UEs have this capability. UDP will be used and other protocols can be tested against it.

This test sends a UDP packet to an internet accessible IP address. The IP is 1.1.1.1 and it belongs to Warp which claims to be the fastest DNS resolver in the world, with OpenDNS, Google and Verisign taking the next respective rankings.

### PTAU

### eDRX

### COPS

### Echo

## PyTest Framework

PyTest is a unit testing framework used to setup the UE for each test using AT commands.

## Field Test Captures

Ublox and Quectel data has been captured for:

* Nokia networks at Vodacom head office in Century City, Cape Town
* ZTE at the MTN Mobile Intelligence Lab, Stellenbosch inside an RF enclosure with the door slightly open before being sealed.
* Ericsson at MTN headquarters on 14th Avenue, Johannesburg
* Huawei in Randburg, JHB

## Post-processing

### Plots

- what aspect is the plot trying to cover, what is it telling me on that topic, shows? observances?
- purpose
- data in the plot saying / deduce / narrative / story
  - Example, Quectel, Vodacom is worse
- 4 sentences
- 4 sentences when comparing nw, and tehn again ues
- What is the take home?

### Probability estimation

Due to the large dataset and requiring a reasonable means of visualization, we can consider a histogram.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{../../code/tests/img2/histogram_counts.pdf}
\captionof{figure}{Example python histogram of a univariate latency distribution showing counts}
\label{fig:}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

[](../../code/tests/img2/histogram_counts.png)

Histogram counts vary among various datasets when their sizes differ, so it would be a good idea to normalize it such that the area under the graph makes 1.0. The probability of the discrete data can also be estimated in a continuous probability density function (PDF) with the kernel density estimation.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{../../code/tests/img2/probability_density_function_seaborn.pdf}
\captionof{figure}{Example python histogram of a univariate latency distribution with a normalized density and a gaussian kernel density estimate}
\label{fig:}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

[](../../code/tests/img2/probability_density_function_seaborn.png)

There are also various types of kernel density estimation, as can be seen here.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=.6\linewidth]{../../code/tests/img2/probability_density_function.pdf}
\captionof{figure}{Various types of kernel density estimation (KDE)}
\label{fig:}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

If the histogram bin values are normalized by dividing by the bin count, adding the values makes 1 instead of integrating along the x-axis. Similarly, multiplying the PDF by its x-axis gives the following result. Although all the plotted values are now truly under 1, the KDE is shifted and doesn't seem usable.  The integration to 1 visualization typical in statistics has to be used.

In fact, good practice would be viewing the data as is and not trying to analyze it from what is essentially an entirely new perspective. Thus, the data will be viewed as 2D plotted points and histograms. Colour will be used to group the data according to attenuation and packet size.

## Dataset

Every UE device and MNO pair (4 total) has 7 main tests and each has its own attenuation zone (5 total). 424 files create a dataset with 1811 trace entries, 40 possible metrics and 79921 values.

Looking at the dataset as a whole this makes 140 unique outcomes (7x4x5). There are 15 subtest types which can be delved into, too.

The dataset is also heavily skewed towards lower latency entries. Tests were repeated with the intent of increasing reliability, especially when it takes a couple of seconds, but when a test took up to 300 seconds it had a much lower chance of being repeated. Also considering that dataset capture may be repeated in different locations, one does not necessarily want to spend more than a day on-site.

To solve for the skewness, each test can be normalized by taking a single mean of each of the associated trace entries and files. Now with a dataset of 140/1811 traces, it makes a minimum of 5600/79921 possible values.

Unfortunately this created problems especially where only a few discrete values are concerned, such as in ECL, as multiple means exist. To solve this, k-means clustering is applied.

### K-Means Clustering

Instead of finding a single mean for all the entries and associated files, at least two means are specified (K=2) to take into account the outliers that some tests produce or more if discrete values are involved or isolated regions (K=3+).

The E-UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) designates the carrier frequency in the uplink and downlink, and ranges between 0-65535.

Since the frequency of the three towers was the same on all three MTN towers, this shows that intra-cell reselection does indeed work.

### SINR

https://www.cablefree.net/wirelesstechnology/4glte/lte-rsrq-sinr/

SINR is a measure of signal quality as well but it is not defined in the 3GPP specs but defined by the UE vendor.

It is not reported to the network. SINR is used a lot by operators, and the LTE industry in general, as it better quantifies the **relationship between RF conditions and Throughput**. LTE UEs typically use SINR to calculate the CQI (Channel Quality Indicator) they report to the network.

It is a common practice to use Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SINR) as an indicator for network quality. It should be however noted that 3GPP specifications do not define SINR and  therefore UE does not report SINR to the network. SINR is still internally measured by most UEs and recorded by drive test tools.

Unfortunately UE chipset and RF scanner manufacturers have implemented SINR measurement in various different ways which are not always easily comparable. While at first it may seem that defining SINR should be unambiguous, in case of LTE downlink this is not the case. This is because different REs within a radio frame carry different physical signals and channels each of which, in turn, see different interference power depending on inter-cell radio frame synchronization.

For example, in a frame-synchronized network, **SINR estimation based on synchronization signals**(PSS/SSS) results in different SINR than SINR estimation based on Reference Signals, since in the latter case the frequency shift of the RS depends on the PCI plan.

# Results {#results}

This section visualizes and analyses the results from the dataset obtained.

## Latency and timing

This sections handles measured and reported latencies and timings versus signal strength to see the effect of different attenuation zones and test types for multiple UE and MNOs.

### Measured latency

This is the time spent consuming current and is measured externally.

#### Latency vs SINR

\begin{minipage}{1.0\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/SNR_txTime_plot.pdf}
\captionof{figure}[Measured latency points (526/1558) under 25 seconds against SINR.]{Measured latency points (526/1558) under 25 seconds in comparison (AB) of UE, (C) MNOs, (DE) attenuation zones, (F) UE-MNO boxplots, (GH) test types, (I) and ECLs against SINR.}
\label{fig:sinr_latency}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

[](../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/SNR_txTime_plot.png)

In Figure \ref{fig:sinr_latency}, (ABCF) Ublox and Quectel share similar characteristics and differ according to MNO. UE has a mean of 2 seconds on MTN-ZTE, and 6-7 seconds on Vodacom-Nokia. (DE) Attenuation per decade is not evident according to SNR. It can be suggested that using SNR as a metric for other tests is not beneficial if the attenuation zones cannot be distinguished. This also suggests that transmit power is a result of RSRP/RSSI variation instead. (GH) Tests are varied across SNR. eDRX paging cycles and COPS maintain similar latencies, however the rest increase three-fold or more. (H) Echo tests have outlier registrations and deregistrations at Vodacom-Nokia. UDP packet byte size does not seem to have an effect on latency. (I) Most of Vodacom-Nokia's dataset is on ECL 1. Increased ECL levels do not seem correlated with latency. (Note) The tail at 200 dB is cleared up as a single K-means cluster point due to excess repetition of one of the tests. At K=5, K-means points are a third of the maximum filtered values, which therefore minimizes the low latency kurtosis and retains the unique features.

Extended Coverage Levels (ECL) are determined by the network. The eNB (base station) sets the number of transmission repetitions (ECL) according to received signal strength reported by the UE.

\label{fig:sinr_latency_otl}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

[](../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/SNR_txTime_outliers.png)

Furthermore, in Figure \label{fig:sinr_latency_otl} latency outliers are (ABC) mostly as a result of Vodacom-Nokia. Both MNOs have outliers up to 300 seconds, but that is for cases where the inactivity timer is active. Since the inactivity timer cannot be controlled by the UE, the next step is to deregister from the network with `AT+COPS=2`. On MTN-ZTE, this is a quick action taking at most a few seconds, however on the Vodacom-Nokia network it can take 40 seconds or more. This is the real latency caveat which makes the Vodacom-Nokia network unusable.

#### Latency vs RSRP

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/Signal_power_txTime_plot.pdf}
\captionof{figure}[Measured Latency points (342/1558) under 25 seconds against RSRP.]{Latency points (342/1558) under 25 seconds in comparison (AB) of UE, (C) MNOs, (DE) attenuation zones, (F) UE-MNO boxplots, (GH) test types, (I) and ECLs against RSRP.}
\label{fig:latency_rsrp}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

[](../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/Signal_power_txTime_plot.png)

[](../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/txTime_histogram.png)

(A) Attenuation per decade is evident. (B) Vodacom latency is up to 5 times greater, excluding outliers. (C) All tests show variation in latency except eDRX. (D) ECL is influenced by RSRP on MTN networks, but does not affect latency. Vodacom's increased latency shows from ECL 1 onwards.

As opposed to Figure \ref{fig:sinr_latency}, in Figure \ref{fig:latency_rsrp} (ABCF) the characteristics of each MNO is distributed more evenly. RSRP measurements are across a 50dBm range for MTN-ZTE and 40dBm for Vodacom-Nokia with the weakest signals around -130dBm and -110dBm respectively. (DE) Attenuation per decade is evident according to RSRP. This RF metric is most beneficial to compare against when measuring the outcome of attenuations. (GH) Tests are varied across RSRP. (G) eDRX paging cycles and PTAU have the quickest latencies under a few seconds whilst COPS has the longest up to 10 seconds. (H) Echo tests have outlier network (de)registrations at Vodacom-Nokia. UDP packet byte size has high variance, yet only has an effect on latency in the fastest transmissions. (I) Most of Vodacom-Nokia's dataset is on ECL 1, yet MTN-ZTE's ECL 1 has much lower latency and variance. Increased ECL levels do not necessarily correlate with latency. Closer inspection is needed per test.

Extended Coverage Levels (ECL) are determined by the network. The eNB (base station) sets the number of transmission repetitions (ECL) according to received signal strength reported by the UE.

\end{center}
\end{minipage}-->

[](../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/Signal_power_txTime_outliers.png)

<!--Furthermore, in Figure \label{fig:latency_rsrp_otl} latency outliers are-->

Since the only difference between the outliers of latency versus SINR (Figure \ref{fig:sinr_latency}) and latency versus RSRP is the fact that the attenuation zones are evident per decade, it is not necessary to show here. What can also be said is that extreme outliers are not cased by attenuation, but is rather network controlled.

### Reported latency

The UE reports TX and RX time via the `AT+NUESTATS="RADIO"` command. It is the transmit and receive time spent on air (using its allocated bandwidth in the RF spectrum).

#### TX time

\begin{minipage}{1.0\linewidth}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/Signal_power_txTimeNW_plot.pdf}
\captionof{figure}[TX time points (325/539) under 20 seconds against RSRP.]{TX time points (325/539) under 20 seconds in comparison (AB) of UE, (C) MNOs, (DE) attenuation zones, (F) UE-MNO boxplots, (GH) test types, (I) and ECLs against RSRP.}
\label{fig:txTimeNW}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

![](../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/Signal_power_txTimeNW_plot.png)

In Figure \ref{fig:txTimeNW}, (AF) the effect of K-means clustering can be seen as it simplifies the variance around -110 to -130dBm as more tests had been take than necessary. Nevertheless, this coincides with (I) higher ECL 2 values. However, ECL is not the only metric that affects latency as there are ECL 0 values in that range as well. As a whole, the UE have low latency and means under 1 second with MTN-ZTE. (BF) Ublox shows poorer performance than Quectel here, yet both have means around 2-3 seconds. (C) The data is almost mutually exclusive and only shares a boundary with TX times under 2 seconds. (DE) Attenuation zones are clearly defined per decade. (GH) UDP packet transmissions are reported greater than 5 seconds, and the rest of the tests as less. (I) ECL might affect latency according to reported TX time.

Although the UE reports satisfactory TX time according to 3GPP standards (under 10 seconds) it is not indicative of the measured latency and it is likely necessary to look at RX time as well. Data for both MNOs falls within the first 5 seconds, unlike what was measured. It is possible that actual on-air time is less than when measuring latency from external energy measurements because the signals are modulated in the time domain (duty cycle, pulse width).

In Figure \ref{fig:txTimeNW_otl}, (ADFG) MTN-ZTE shows no outliers, but (BC) Vodacom-Nokia shows outliers for both Ublox and Quectel. (E) Attenuation does not affect TX time. (H) If not a lengthy UDP packet transmission, both eDRX and PTAU have a single outlier which could be a result of an RRC connection with a long inactivity timer, synchronization error or else.

#### RX Time

(A) Attenuation zones clearly defined per decade. (B) MTN RX and TX time mainly within 2.5 seconds. Vodacom mainly up to 10 seconds. (C) All tests show variation in RX time except eDRX. (D) ECL does not affect RX time on MTN, however most of the tests at Vodacom show ECL 1 and above.

The on-air time for receiving from the network is at least twice as much as the TX time metric. It is more comparable to the external energy-latency measurements and suggests that more energy is spent on receiving than necessary.

### C-DRX duty cycle

On the Vodafone network in connected-DRX (C-DRX) mode, the UE is observed to show peaks spaced at regular 2.048s intervals [@Martinez2019]. On both Vodacom and MTN networks, these peaks are not visible and instead a steady stream of peaks can be seen as on the following images. The peaks indicate an on time of roughly 12ms and idle of 4 seconds. With a cycle of 16ms, it fits the LTE requirements of between 10ms and 2560ms in terms of 1ms subframes. However, NB-IoT has a minimum requirement of 256ms to 9216ms for the interval length between C-DRX transmissions. This means that NB-IoT is utilizing vastly more time on air than permitted by the 3GPP and it is having a detrimental effect on the estimated battery life. Lastly, this does not bode well for the scaling up of devices due to the interference, especially on the shared uplink (NPUSCH) channel.

### Summary

There is a large discrepancy in the measured latency between MTN-ZTE and Vodacom-Nokia.

## Power efficiency

There is a large discrepancy in the energy consumption between MTN and Vodacom.

The inefficiency between the two South African MNOs can either be attributed to poor system configuration, or hardware fault. That is, if the network vendor meets the 3GPP's standards.

Energy outliers mainly from Vodacom at ECL 1 and the COPS, PTAU or UDP packet test.

All in all, Vodacom uses up to 40 times (200 Joules) more than MTN (up to 5 Joules).

On a generic 3.7V lithium battery with 4Ah of storage, it has 14800mWh in total. In worst case scenarios, at 14mWh it will last for 1057 transmissions, and at the outlying 200mWh it will last for 74 transmissions. In terms of MTN, at 5 Joules (1.4mWh) there are 10570 transmissions available, and with Vodacom at 200 Joules (56mWh) it will last for 266 transmissions.

With daily transmissions, one can hope for a year when connected to Vodacom, and with MTN it far exceeds the 10 year 3GPP standard with 28 years. This leaves enough room for scheduled downlink transmissions using eDRX.

roughly between 70 and 120mA, and skewed towards higher consumption. It is also clamped at 128mA due to measurement limitations. 

(A) Attenuation zones evident. (B) Both MTN and Vodacom share similar distributions of max current usage. (C) Tests are varied, yet UDP packet transmission tend to use more current. (D) ECL does not affect current usage.

### Transmit Power

\captionof{figure}[Transmit powers of packets (204/1597) up to 23dBm against RSRP.]{Transmit powers of packets (204/1597) from -10 to 23 dBm in comparison (AB) of UE, (C) MNOs, (DE) attenuation zones, (F) UE-MNO boxplots, (GH) test types, (I) and ECLs against RSRP.}
\label{fig:}
\end{center}
\end{minipage}

[](../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/Signal_power_TX_power_plot.png)

(A) Transmit power decreases proportional to RSRP from around -100 dBm and stronger. (B) Attenuation/RSRP affects transmit power on MTN, and Vodacom remains at the 23 dBm max. (C) Variation in all tests. (D) ECL 0 and 1 uses less power but ECL 2 remains at max power.

The UE maintains a max output power of 23 dBm when connected to Vodacom towers, and decreases proportional to RSRP/RSSI on MTN towers. When comparing energy and latency to transmit power, both show variation at 23 dBm and decrease at lower powers which indicates that although it is a contributing factor it is definitely more affected by time on air.

[](../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/TX_power_histogram.png)

Around -100 dBm devices decrease their output power at roughly 10 dBm per decade of RSRP amplification when connected to MTN towers. This might be attributable to the ECL level that the eNodeB sets for the UE. If the tests are repeated for RSRP signals greater than -70 dBm, it can be assumed that the transmit power will eventually decrease to -56 dBm according to the AT+UTEST command in the Ublox N2 datasheet. If the transmit power decreases linearly according to RSRP, minimum output power would be achieved at -20 dBm or greater.

### Joules per second

\end{center}
\end{minipage}

[](../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/txTime_energy_plot.png)

(A) Attenuation zones show variation. (B) UE-MNO pairings show similar trends, yet is possible (more in Vodacom's case) for latency to increase and energy levels to remain the same. (C) Tests show variation. (D) Increased ECL indicated higher latency and energy consumption.

After 5 seconds UEs consume 1 Joule per second when connected to a tower and after 15 seconds 3 Joules per second at most. However, it is possible to use energy more efficiently and increase latency.

 exist from 25 seconds onwards, and it follows the same structure as the above. The majority of outliers are Vodacom's.

It is evident that on all attenuation levels there is a high degree of variation in latency and energy, and thus correlation with attenuation is unlikely. Considering the discrepancy between MTN and Vodacom is up to a ten-fold difference, the latter's Nokia towers are vastly inefficient. Lastly, most of the test data falls within the first 10 seconds, with eDRX power saving being the most efficient, and network registration or sending large UDP packets being the least.

(A) Attenuation zones evident and potentially affect packet size. (B) UE-MNO pairs share similar characteristics. (C) Different tests are grouped with similar sizes with UDP packets being the largest, and COPS the smallest. (D) ECL does not seem to affect packet size.

In general packets are around 100-300 bytes in size and all UE-MNO pairings share similar sizes. There are a few subtle trend lines which suggest that packet size increases proportionally to decreased RSRP.

[txBytes_histogram](../../../masters/code/tests/plotterk/txBytes_histogram.png)

Attenuation zones do not affect packet size. Vodacom has outliers above 10kB. All outliers are as a result of UDP packet tests and ECL does not seem to affect packet size.

There is a large degree of variation in packet sizes expected to be up to 512 bytes, with sizes up to 10kB or more recorded. That's a 20-fold difference which certainly means on can run out of budget on data costs sooner than expected. The prices of packet-switched data in South Africa is high due to ICASA regulations and is the cause of much competition for remaining spectrum when most is still being used for analogue television broadcast by the SABC.

# Discussion and Recommendations {#discussion}

Fix NW config.

## Optimal network configuration

Avoid -120 dBm - -130 dBm region



# Conclusion {#conclusion}

Attenuation does not affect performance as much as the ECL level does, and includes
degradation to latency, energy consumption and packet size.

The inefficiency between the two South African MNOs can either be attributed to poor
system configuration, or hardware fault. That is, if the network vendor meets the 3GPP's
standards. Vodacom’s Nokia infrastructure has failed one of the most important
requirements for NB-IoT being under 10 seconds latency for all network conditions.
Secondly it is 20dBm RSRP less sensitive than MTN’s ZTE infrastructure, which has
satisfactory performance overall. Since the findings are reflected similarly across the
Ublox and Quectel UE, it implies that the discrepancies are as a result of the MNO
vendor.

  * The NB-IoT coverage gain versus GSM is in line with Vodafone’s target, while recent testing activities have also demonstrated excellent network performance, exceeding Vodafone’s expectations: the uplink first transmission success rate is greater than 97%, reaching 99.9% with retransmissions.

    Vodafone is working with multiple chipset and module suppliers to enable testing and trial opportunities, as well as device interoperability testing. It has tested devices from Neul and Qualcomm against Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia systems in multiple regions. All of these vendors’ NB-IoT Radio Access Network technology has been successfully interconnected with Vodafone’s core Internet of Things network.
